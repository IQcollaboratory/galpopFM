\section{The Slab Model Based EDA}  \label{sec:slab} 
\ch{ 
    In our \eda~prescription, we use the slab model to determine $A_V$, the
    amplitude of attenuation, as a function of a randomly sampled inclination,
    $i$, and $\tau_V$ (see Eq.~\ref{eq:slab} in Section~\ref{sec:dem}).
    The slab model is based on the assumption that dust in galaxies have
    slab-like geometry and illuminated by the stellar radiation
    source~\citep{somerville1999}. 
}
For a given $\tau_V$, the attenuation depends solely on the orientation of the galaxy. 
\ch{
    While this simplification reproduces the correlation between $A_V$ and $i$
    found in observed star-forming galaxies~\citep[\eg][]{conroy2010, wild2011,
    battisti2017, salim2020}, it ignores the detailed star-to-dust geometry that
    impacts the attenuation curve. 
    It also does not provide a well-motivated prescription for quiescent
    galaxies, which typically have elliptical morphologies.
    Despite its limitations, the slab model provides a robust empirical
    prescription that allows us to produce realistic distributions of $A_V$. 
}

In Figure~\ref{fig:av_dist}, we compare the $A_V$ distributions, $p(A_V)$,
of star-forming galaxies in SDSS (blue) and galaxies in the
\cite{salim2018} GSWLC2 sample (orange) to the $p(A_V)$ generated from the
slab model (black dashed). 
The $A_V$ values of the SDSS are derived using SED fitting from the
\cite{brinchmann2004} MPA-JHU catalog.
The $A_V$ values of the GSWLC2 galaxies are also derived from SED fitting UV and optical
photometry from GALEX and SDSS observations as well as mid-IR photometry from WISE. 
We include all GSWLC2 galaxies, including quiescent galaxies, above $M_* > 10^{10}M_\odot$. 
We generate two $p(A_V)$ with the slab model for the SDSS and GSWLC2
samples separately.
For each SDSS/GSWLC2 galaxy, we determine $A_V$ by uniformly sampling 
$\cos i$ from 0 to 1 and derive $\tau_V$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:tauv}) with the
galaxy's measured $M_*$ and $\ssfr$. 
We pick $\mtaum, \mtaus, c_\tau$ values within the prior range
(Table~\ref{tab:free_param}) by hand to roughly reproduce the SDSS and GSWLC2 $p(A_V)$
distributions. 

Galaxies in SDSS and GSWLC2 have substantially different $p(A_V)$. 
While the galaxy populations only partially overlap, this difference is 
{\em mostly} due to inconsistencies in the $A_V$ measurements of MPA-JHU and GSWLC2 --- even
for the same galaxy, the $A_V$ measurements from the two catalogs differ significantly. 
%In fact for the ${\sim}8000$ galaxies that are in both samples, the $A_V$ distributions appear similar to those of the corresponding complete samples.}
This difference in $p(A_V)$ illustrates the challenges in directly measuring
dust attenuation and yet again highlights the advantages of our forward
modeling approach. 
Despite the dramatic differences between the two, the slab model can
produce $p(A_V)$ in good agreement with both observed distributions. 
We therefore conclude that the slab model provides a sufficiently flexible
prescription to sample a realistic distribution of $A_V$. 

\begin{figure}

    Dependence of $A_V$ on $M_*$ (left) and $\ssfr$ (right) for the
    \cite{salim2018} GSWLC2 sample.
    In the left panel, we divide the GSWLC2 sample into bins of $\ssfr$: 
    $\ssfr < 10^{-11}yr^{-1}$ (purple), 
    $10^{-11} < \ssfr < 10^{-10}yr^{-1}$ (red),
    and  $10^{-10} < \ssfr$ (orange). 
    In each of the $\ssfr$ bins, we find significant $M_*$ dependence. 
    In the right panel, we divide the sample into bins of $M_*$:  
    $10^{9.5} < M_* < 10^{10.5}M_\odot$ (blue) and $10^{10.5} M_\odot < M_*$ (green).
    In the $M_* > 10^{10.5}M_\odot$ bin, which roughly corresponds to our
    SDSS sample, we find significant $\ssfr$ dependence.
    The $M_*$ and $\ssfr$ dependence in $A_V$ we find in GSWLC2 is
    consistent with previous works and provides further motivation for our
    \eda~prescription.
    }
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In addition to the slab model, in the \eda, we also use a linear
dependence on $M_*$ and $\ssfr$ in the $V$ band optical depth,
$\tau_V$ (see Eq.~\ref{eq:tauv}).
This parameterization is motivated by observations that find significant
correlation between $A_V$ and $M_*$ and $\ssfr$~\citep[\eg~][]{garn2010, battisti2016, salim2020}. 
We take a closer look at this correlation using the GWSLC2 sample in
Figure~\ref{fig:dep}.
We present the dependence of $A_V$ on $M_*$ (left panel) and $\ssfr$ (right
panel). 
In the left panel, we divide the GSWLC2 galaxies by $\ssfr$: 
$\ssfr < 10^{-11}yr^{-1}$ (purple), $10^{-11} < \ssfr < 10^{-10}yr^{-1}$
(red), and  $10^{-10} < \ssfr$ (orange). 
For each of the $\ssfr$ bins, we find significant $\log M_*$ dependence in
$A_V$: galaxies with higher $\ssfr$ have a stronger $M_*$ dependence.  
In the right, we divide the galaxies by $M_*$: 
$10^{9.5} < M_* < 10^{10.5}M_\odot$ (blue) and $10^{10.5} M_\odot < M_*$
(green).
Although both $M_*$ bins have some $\ssfr$ dependence, the dependence is
stronger for galaxies with $M_* > 10^{10.5}M_\odot$. 
This stellar mass limit roughly corresponds to galaxies that are included
in our forward model (see Figure~\ref{fig:avmsfr}). 
The $M_*$ and $\ssfr$ dependence we find in $A_V$ from the GSWLC2 sample is
consistent with previous observations and further motivates our
\eda~prescription.

    $M_*$ and $\ssfr$ dependence of dust attenuation at $1500 \AA$
    ($A_{1500}$; top) and at $5500\AA$ ($A_{V}$; bottom) of SDSS galaxies. 
    The sample includes 2361 galaxies that pass our selection cut
    (Section~\ref{sec:obs}) and are also part of the GSWLC2 and MPA-JHU
    samples. 
    In the left panels, we use $A_{1500}$ and $A_V$ from GSWLC2.
    In the center panel, we use $A_V$ from MPA-JHU. 
    In the right panel, we use $A_V$ from the NSA. 
    Same as Figure~\ref{fig:avmsfr}, the colormap in each hexbin represents the
    median attenuation for all galaxies in the bin (right color bar).
    We only include bins with more than 5 galaxies.
    The bottom panels illustrate that $A_V$ measurements from GSWLC2, MPA-JHU,
    and NSA differ {\em significantly} even for the same galaxies.
    We, therefore, refrain from directly comparing our \eda~predictions to
    observations.

In Figure~\ref{fig:av_obs}, we present the $M_*$ and $\ssfr$ dependence of dust
attenuation in SDSS galaxies, which contains 2361 galaxies that pass our
selection cut and are also in the GSWLC2 and MPA-JHU samples.
In the top panel, we present $A_{1500}$ from GSWLC2 as a function of $M_*$ and
$\ssfr$.
In the bottom panels, we present $A_V$ from GSWLC2 (left), MPA-JHU (center),
and NSA (right).
The NSA $A_V$ measurements are derived assuming intrinsic Balmer decrement of
2.85, $R_V=3.1$ and \cite{odonnell1994} extinction. 
The colormap in each hexbin represents the median attenuation for galaxies in
the bin, same  as in Figure~\ref{fig:avmsfr}. 
Bins with less than 5 galaxies are omitted. 
The bottom left panel illustrates that we find the same same $M_*$ and $\ssfr$
dependence of $A_V$ as Figure~\ref{fig:dep} even after our selection cut. 
In the bottom panels, we find that $A_V$ from GSWLC2, MPA-JHU, and NSA have
significant differently amplitudes. 
Since observations have large discrepancies among dust attenuation measurements
and a detailed comparison is beyond the scope of this work, we refrain from
comparing our \eda~predicted dust attenuation (Section~\ref{sec:results}) to
observations.
