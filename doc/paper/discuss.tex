\subsection{Discussion}  
We make a number of assumptions and choices in our \eda~prescription. 
\ch{
    First, we use the slab model (Eq.~\ref{eq:slab}) to assign $A_V$ as a
    function of the randomly sampled $i$ and $\tau_V$. 
    This choice is based on the fact that the slab model reproduces the 
    correlation between attenuations and inclination found in 
    observations~\citep{conroy2010b, wild2011, battisti2017, salim2020} as well
    as simulations~\citep[\eg][]{chevallard2013, narayanan2018, trayford2020}.
}
It can also reproduce the SDSS $A_V$ distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:av_dist}). If
we replace the slab model with a more flexible model for sampling $A_V$ using
truncated normal distributions, we find that our results are not significantly
impacted (see Appendix~\ref{sec:slab} for details). Therefore, we conclude
that our results do not sigificantly depend on our choice of the slab model. 
\ch{
    In our \eda, we also use a parameterization of $\tau_V$ and $\delta$ that
    depend linearly on $\log M_*$ and $\log {\rm SSFR}$. 
    While the $M_*$ and $\ssfr$ dependence of $A_V$ is well-motivated and is
    found in, for instance, the \cite{salim2018} GSWLC2 catalog (Appendix~\ref{sec:slab}), 
    the linear dependence was chosen primarily for its simplicity.
    The \eda~framework can be easily extended to more flexible
    parameterizations. 
}
In fact, a more flexible parameterization would likely reduce 
some of the discrepancies with the SDSS color-magnitude relations. The
\eda~produces broader distributions of optical colors than SDSS. Few galaxies
in SDSS have $\gr > 1.$ while some galaxies in the \eda~broadly extend beyond
this cut-off. In the UV, the \eda~struggles to accurately reproduce the redder
portions ($\fnuv > 1.5$) of the UV color-magnitude relation. The main
challenges for a more flexible parameterization would be model selection and
finding a well-motivated parameterization. 
\ch{
    Notwithstanding, for SDSS observations, our \eda~prescription using
    parameter values from the TNG and EAGLE posteriors find good agreement.
}

\ch{
    We demonstrate in this work that accounting for dust attenuation is
    essential when comparing simulations to observations. 
}
None of the simulations reproduce the UV and optical color-magnitude relation
without dust attenuation (Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). 
\ch{ 
    Furthermore, the fact that we can use the \eda~to reproduce SDSS observations 
    for different hydrodynamical simulations highlights how our current lack of 
    understanding of dust limits our ability to closely compare galaxy
    formation models. 
    Our \eda~prescription is built on our current understanding of dust
    attenuation in galaxies: \eg~the \citealt{noll2009} parameterization, the
    UV bump, the slab model, etc.
}
Yet with the \eda, two simulations that predict galaxy populations with
significantly different physical properties (Figure~\ref{fig:smf_msfr}) can
reproduce the same SDSS observations. 
This suggests that dust is highly degenerate with the differences between simulations. 
Put another way --- if we were to marginalize over dust in our comparison to observations, we would not
be able to differentiate between the different galaxy physics prescriptions in
the simulations. 
Hence, current limitations in our understanding of dust is 
a major bottleneck for investigating galaxy formation using simulations.
\ch{
    In the next paper of the series, Starkenburg et al. (in preparation), we
    will examine whether we can compare the prescriptions for star formation
    quenching in different galaxy formation models once we include the
    \eda~framework.

    energy balance.  Despite reproducing the same SDSS UV and optical
    color-magnitude relations, \emph{the \eda~predicts significantly different
    IR dust emission for TNG and EAGLE}. Therefore, including IR
    observations will significantly improve the constraints on \eda~parameters
    and allow us to better differentiate galaxy formation models.

%There's hope! 
Fortunately, there are many avenues for improving our understanding of dust
with a forward modeling approach. In this work, we used a restrictive $M_r <
-20$ complete SDSS galaxy sample. 
\ch{
    Figure~\ref{fig:avmsfr} illustrates that our completeness cut limits the
    number of quiescent galaxies below $M_* < 10^{11}M_\odot$.  
}
Instead of imposing a completeness limit, 
we can include the actual SDSS selection function in the forward 
model~\citep[\eg~][]{dickey2020}. 
\ch{
    This would allow us to compare the simulations with \eda~to the entire SDSS
    sample, a substantially larger sample with a wider range of galaxies. 
}
Upcoming surveys, such as the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) of the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument~\citep[DESI;][]{desicollaboration2016, ruiz-macias2020} 
and galaxy evolution survey of the Prime Focus
Spectrograph~\citep[PFS;][]{takada2014,tamura2016}, will also vastly expand galaxy
observations. 
\ch{ 
    BGS, for instance, will measure $10\times$ the number of galaxy spectra as
    SDSS out to $z\sim0.4$  and with its $r\sim20$ magnitude limit will probe
    a significant number of low redshift dwarf galaxies. 
    Such an observational sample will allow us to place tigher constraints on
    the \eda~parameters, which may enable comparisons of the underlying galaxy
    formation models, 
    and shed light on dust in a broader range of galaxies. 
}

\ch{
    In this work, we also only used observables derived from UV and optical
    photometry, which means that we have only examined one side of the impact
    that dust has on galaxy spectra.
}
While dust attenuates light in the optical and UV, it emits light in
IR. In fact, even though the TNG and EAGLE simulations reproduce the same UV and
optical color-magnitude relations with the \eda, they predict significantly 
different dust emission in the IR. In Figure~\ref{fig:lir}, we present IR dust
emission luminosity, $L_{\rm IR}$, predicted by the \eda~with median parameter values of 
the TNG (blue) and EAGLE (green) posteriors as as a function of the $r$-band 
absolute magnitude, $M_r$. The dust emissions are estimated using the standard
energy balance assumption --- \ie~all starlight attenuated by dust is reemitted 
in the IR~\citep{dacunha2008}. 

Despite reproducing the same SDSS UV and optical color-magnitude relations, the
\eda~predicts significantly different IR dust emission for TNG and EAGLE. For
TNG, the \eda~predicts an overall ${\sim}0.3$ dex ($2\times$) higher dust
emissions than for EAGLE. Higher dust emission for TNG
is consistent with the higher $\ctau$ we infer for TNG (Figure~\ref{fig:abc}).
It is also consistent with the fact that TNG predicts bluer galaxies and more
luminous quiescent galaxies with red $\fnuv$ color than EAGLE
(Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). Since IR dust emission measures the total dust
attenuation, IR observations would specifically constrain the \eda~and
therefore break degeneracies between dust and the galaxy physics in simulations.
\ch{
    Upcoming will provide crucial observation on this front.  
    BGS, for instance, will have IR photometry from NEOWISE~\citep{meisner2018}. 
    \emph{James Webb Space Telecope (JWST)} will also provide valuable IR
    observations.

(1998) and Jonsson et al. (2006), and showed that all the stud- ies predict, with some normalization differences, a relationship between the optical depth AV and attenuation law slope.

% Salmon+(2016): There is evidence that galaxy inclination correlates with the strength of Lyα emission, such that we observe less Lyα equivalent width for more edge-on galaxies (Charlot & Fall 1993; Laursen & Sommer-Larsen 2007; Yajima et al. 2012; Verhamme et al. 2012; U et al. 2015)
% Therefore, based on physi- cal models, one expects that galaxies with “greyer” dust laws and larger overall attenuation should have higher inclinations
% Salim+(2018): Chevallard et al. (2013) furthermore show that the depend- ence of the slope on AV is the same irrespective of whether the AV is driven by different levels of intrinsic (face-on) attenuation or is the result of inclined viewing geometry.
