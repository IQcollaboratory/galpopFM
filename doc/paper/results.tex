\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
% dust model can reproduce color magnitude relation
Without dust attenuation, all of the hydrodynamical simulations struggle to 
reproduce the $(\gr) - M_r$ and $(\fnuv) - M_r$ relations of SDSS (Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). 
In optical, the simulations predict significantly bluer colors and find  
broader differences in color, ${\sim}0.5~mag$, between star-forming and
quiescent galaxies. In the UV, they predict quiescent galaxies with $\ssfr <
10^{-12}yr^{-1}$ that have redder $\fnuv$ colors beyond SDSS observations. 
Meanwhile, for the rest of the galaxies, the simulations predict significantly
bluer UV colors than SDSS. 

\emph{With the \eda~model, all of the simulations are able to
reproduce the color-magnitude relations of SDSS.} In Figure~\ref{fig:dem}, 
we present the optical and UV color-magnitude relations predicted by the 
\eda~for the SIMBA (orange), TNG (blue), and EAGLE (green) simulations. 
For the \eda~parameters, we use the median of the posterior distributions 
inferred using ABC (Figure~\ref{fig:abc}). The contours mark the $68\%$ and 
$95\%$ confidence intervals of the distributions.

%By comparing the color-magnitude relations produced with and without the \eda, we can examine how dust attenuation can produce observations. 

Dust dramatically impacts the observables of simulations. The \eda~affects the 
the optical and UV color-magnitude relations in three major ways to produce
good agreement with SDSS. First, the \eda~significantly reddens simulated galaxies in both 
the optical and UV.  Overall, $\gr$ colors are ${\sim}0.25~mag$ redder and 
$\fnuv$ colors ${\sim}0.5~mag$ redder. Second, the \eda~significantly attenuates
(${\sim}0.5~mag$) intrinsically blue galaxies (\ie~star-forming galaxies with
$\log~{\rm SSFR} > -10.5$). As a result, there are no longer luminous optically blue 
galaxies ($M_r < -21$ and $\gr < 0.5$) --- consistent with observations.
Lastly, in the UV, the \eda~attenuates low SSFR quiescent galaxies that are 
intrinsically red in the UV ($\fnuv{\sim}3~mag$) by ${\sim}1~mag$. Thus, unlike in
Figure~\ref{fig:obs}, the UV color-magnitude relations from the \eda~do not
have galaxies with high $\fnuv$ as in SDSS.

% Do we want to comment on the variation in the eda attenuation curve and how
% that mixes up the color for a given SSFR? 

% paragraph on SIMBA discrepancy
For SIMBA, the \eda~substantially improves the agreement with observations;
however, there are still some significant discrepancies in the color-magnitude
relations with SDSS. The \eda~products a $\gr$ color distribution that is too
narrow and a $\fnvu$ distribution that is too wide. Also, the inferred \eda~parameters 
for SIMBA differ significantly from the parameters of TNG and EAGLE
(Figure~\ref{fig:abc}). These discrepancies are primarily driven by the
large population of high $\log{\rm SSFR} > -9.5$ ``starburst'' galaxies that
lie above the SFS, which are {\em only} present in SIMBA (Figure~\ref{fig:smf_msfr}). 
Without dust attenuation, these starburst galaxies are blue $\gr\sim0.1$ and
have high luminosity, $M_r < -22$. Such high luminosity blue galaxies are not
present in observations, so these SIMBA galaxies need to be both strongly 
attenuated and reddened. This would, however, contradict the attenuation-slope 
relation established in both observations and simulations where galaxies with 
higher attenuation have shallower
slopes~\citep{inoue2005,chevallard2013,salim2018,salim2020,trayford2020}.
To further examine the impact of the starburst galaxies in SIMBA, we ran the \eda~for SIMBA excluding galaxies with $\log{\rm SSFR} > -9.5$ and 
with median parameter values of the TNG and EAGLE posteriors. Without its starburst
galaxies, SIMBA produces color-magnitude relations in good agreement 
with observations. {\em We conclude that the excess starburst population in 
SIMBA is in tension with observations}. Examining the prescriptions that
produce the starburst in SIMBA is beyond the scope of this paper. Therefore,
for the rest of the paper, we focus on the TNG and EAGLE simulations.  

% comparison to literature 
Previous works in the literature have also compared simulations with different
dust prescriptions to observations in color-magnitude space. For EAGLE, 
\cite{trayford2015} calculate colors and luminosities with the {\sc Galaxev}
population synthesis models and a two-component screen model for dust. More
recently, \cite{trayford2017} calculated optical colors for EAGLE using {\sc
Skirt}, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code~\citep{camps2015}, to model the
dust. At stellar masses and luminosities comparable to our SDSS sample, both 
\cite{trayford2015} and \cite{trayford2017} produce red sequences bluer than 
in GAMA observations. Also, \cite{trayford2015} predict an excess of luminous 
blue galaxies. Although a detailed comparison is difficult since both works 
compare to different observations, we note that with the \eda, EAGLE is able 
to successfully reproduce the position of the SDSS red sequence and does not 
predict a significant excess of luminous blue galaxies. Also using EAGLE and 
{\sc Skirt}, \cite{baes2019} find that they overesimtate the observed cosmic 
SED (CSED) in the UV regime and produce significantly higher $\fnuv$ color 
than GAMA. The \eda~predicts $\fnuv$ in good agreement with SDSS. 
%\cite{baes2019}: EAGLE+SKIRT SED compparison with GAMA Far UV is not attenuated enough. underrestimates optical and NIR
For TNG, \cite{nelson2018} calculate optical colors using a dust model that
includes attenuation due to dense gas birth clouds surrounding young stellar
populations and also due to simulated distribution of neutral gas and metals.
They find bluer red sequence peaks and a narrower blue cloud compared to SDSS.
We find neither of these discrepancies for the TNG with the~\eda. The
\eda~is a simpler prescription for applying dust attenuation than the dust
models in these works. Yet, with its flexibility, we are able to produce
optical and UV color-magnitude relations that are in good agreement with
observations. Furthermore, with its low computation costs we were able o fully
explore our dust parameters.

%They find that
%star-forming galaxies with higher SFR have higher attenuation; however, this
%trend is driven by the $M_*$ dependence since star-forming galaxies lie on 
%the star-forming sequence~\citep{garn2010, battisti2017}. At fixed $M_*$,
%observations find no strong $\sfr$ dependence for the star-forming population. 
%Since previous works do not include quiescent galaxies, %\cite{tress2018} find positive dependence between E(B-V) (color excess) with M* and negative dependence with
%SSFR for 1753 star-forming galaxies within 1.5 < z < 3.

%In \cite{leja2017}, they similar find composite and AGN galaxies
%to have shallow attenuation curves with higher $A_V$; however, the comparison
%is limited due to ther smaller sample size (129 galaxies). In contrast,

%steeper curves; they, however, focus their analysis mainly on star-forming 
%galaxies.

% Kartheik on why dust is hard to constrain for quiescent galaxies: 
%firstly because quiescent galaxies don't have much recent SFR and therefore not much dust (their most recently produced dust has likely happened more than a dust destruction timescale ago), 
% secondly because the continuum for quiescent galaxies is super hard to fit (and break degeneracies with SFH & metallicity), which leads to poor(er) constraints. You could basically think of this in terms of dust/total SNR, which drops sharply for this population.
