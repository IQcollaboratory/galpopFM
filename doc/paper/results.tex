\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
We present the posterior distributions of the DEM parameters for the SIMBA
(orange), TNG (blue), and EAGLE (green) hydro simulations in
Figure~\ref{fig:abc}. The DEM parameters include $\mtaum$, $\mtaus$, and
$\ctau$, which parameterize the $M_*$ dependence, $\sfr$ dependence, and 
amplitude of $\tau_V$, the $V$-band optical depth. $\tau_V$ dictates the
overall strength of the dust attenuation. They also include $\mdeltam$,
$\mdeltas$, and $\cdelta$, which parameterize the $M_*$ dependence, $\sfr$ dependence,
and amplitude of $\delta$, the slope offset of the attenuation curve
(Section~\ref{sec:dem} and Table~\ref{tab:free_param}). The posteriors 
are derived using ABC (Section~\ref{sec:abc}) and the contours mark the 
$68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence intervals. 

In addition, we present the observables predicted by the DEM with median of the
posteriors for the SIMBA (orange), TNG (blue), and EAGLE (green) simulations 
in Figure~\ref{fig:dem}. We include the SDSS observables for comparison
(black dashed; Section~\ref{sec:obs}). The top panels present the $(G-R) - M_r$ 
color-magnitude relations while the bottom panels present the $(FUV-NUV) - M_r$
relations. Without any dust prescriptions, we found that simulations predict
dramatically different observables than SDSS (Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). 
\ch{something about clear bimodality with the red sequence and blue cloud} 
In contrast, {\em using DEMs we produce $(G-R) - M_r$ and $(FUV-NUV) - M_r$
relations consistent with SDSS for all of the simulations}. 

We examine the observables more closely in Figure~\ref{fig:demcloseup}, where
we present the $G-R$ (left) and $FUV-NUV$ (right) distributions in $M_r$ 
bins for the DEM models of the SIMBA (orange), TNG (blue), and EAGLE (green) 
simulations. The top panels contain galaxies with $-20 > M_r > -21$ and the 
bottom panels contain galaxies with $-21 > M_r > -22.5$. In each panel we 
include the SDSS distributions for comparison. These distributions are 
number densities. The positions of the red sequence and blue cloud in the $G-R$
distributions for the DEM models are consistent with the SDSS distribution. 
They also produce $FUV_NUV$ distributions with peaks consistent with
observations. We also find good agreement in the overall normalization
(number density), especially for the $-20 > M_r > -21$ bin. 

There are also a few discrepancies between the DEM models and SDSS observations. 
First, the red sequence in the observed $G-R$ distribution has a sharp red color 
cut-off.  In contrast, we do not find as sharp of a $G-R$ cut off in the DEM models, 
and find a small fraction of galaxies redder than observations. 
Furthermore, while the DEM models for TNG and EAGLE agree with SDSS, the DEM
model for SIMBA overpredicts blue galaxies. \ch{what do we want to do with
SIMBA?} We also find that the TNG and EAGLE DEM models slightly overpredict 
galaxies in the higher luminosity bin and produce a broader $G-R$ distribution.
Nonetheless, Figure~\ref{fig:demcloseup} demonstrates that overall the DEM
models for SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE produce observables are in good agreement 
with SDSS.

% comparison to literature 
% First EAGLE
Previous works in the literature have also presented models that predict colors
and luminosities for different simulations and dust models and compared them to
observations. For instance, \cite{trayford2015} calculate colors and luminosities 
for $z=0.1$ galaxies using EAGLE with the {\sc GALAXEV} population synthesis models 
and a two-component screen model for dust. Compared to GAMA observations, their
model produces a bluer red sequence and overpredicts luminous blue galaxies~\citep[][Figure
5]{trayford2015}. Although a detailed comparison is difficult since they
compare all galaxies, not just centrals, we note that the DEM models find good
agreement in the positions of the red sequences. Furthermore, for TNG and EAGLE, 
the DEM models do not overpredict blue galaxies. Even for SIMBA, the DEM model
overpredict blue galaxies by a smaller amount.

More recently, \cite{trayford2017} calculated optical colors for the EAGLE simulation using
{\sc SKIRT}, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code~\citep{camps2015}, to model the dust. 
\cite{trayford2017} compares all galaxies so again, we do not include a direct 
comparison. Compared to GAMA, while they find good agreement with observations 
at intermediate masses, $10^{10.5} < M_* < 10^{10.8} M_\odot$, they again find
a bluer red-sequence at $10^{11.2} < M_* < 10^{11.5}$. While we do not present
comparisons in $M_*$ bins, which compare SED derived $M_*$ to the predicted
$M_*$ from simulations, we find that the position of the red sequence in the
DEM models are in good agreement with SDSS even at $M_* > 10^{11.2}$. Our models, 
however, predict an overall broader color distribution at the high mass end. 
Using the same \cite{trayford2017} EAGLE and {\sc SKIRT} framework,
\cite{baes2019} compared the predicted cosmic spectral energy distributions
(CSED) to observations. While this comparison averages over the galaxy
populations, they find the EAGLE-{\sc SKIRT} CSED overestimates the observed
CSED in the UV regime. Moreover, the $FUV-NUV$ color of their CSED is
significantly higher than GAMA $FUV-NUV$. The DEM models on the other hand, 
predict $FUV-NUV$ in good agreement with observations. 

%\cite{baes2019}: EAGLE+SKIRT SED compparison with GAMA Far UV is not attenuated enough. underrestimates optical and NIR
% then TNG
Besides with EAGLE, \cite{nelson2018} calculated optical colors for the
TNG simulations with a dust model that includes attenuation due to dense gas 
birth clouds surrounding young stellar populations and also attenuation due to 
simulated distribution of neutral gas and metals.
Although they compare the color distribution for all galaxies in bins of $M_*$,
so we cannot directly compare to the DEM models, compared to SDSS they find 
bluer red sequence peak position and narrower blue cloud. We find neither of
these discrepancies between the DEM models and SDSS. 
\ch{restatement of how the DEM models have the flexibility to reproduce the
optical and UV color-magnitude relationship.}

The simulations with DEMs predict observables in agreement with observations 
despite the significant differents in the SMFs and $M_*$-SFR relations 
(Figures~\ref{fig:smfs} and~\ref{fig:msfr}). In other words, the DEM has the 
flexiblity to reproduce observations even when simulations predict galaxy
populations with significantly different physical properties. We emphasize that
the DEM is based on the standard prescriptions for dust attenuation and, thus,
serve as a flexible parameterization within the bounds of our current
understanding of dust in galaxies.

Figures~\ref{fig:dem} and~\ref{fig:demcloseup} highlights two key points. First, any comparison of
simulations must account for dust. Dust entirely changes the predictions of
simulations in observables-space. Fortunately, the DEM provides a simple framework
for including dust without the need for expensive ray-tracing methods. 
Second, the current limiations in our understanding of dust in galaxies 
significant impedes our ability to understand galaxy formation from simulations. 
To robustly interpret any comparison of simulations, we would need to
marginalize over dust (\emph{e.g.} DEM parameters). Since DEMs can produce
consistent observables for a range of simulations, marginalizing over dust
would leave little constraining power on the subgrid prescriptions (\emph{i.e.}
galaxy physics) of the simulations. 

% comparison across the simulations 
\ch{What do the differences in DEM parameters say about the differences among
the hydro sims?}

% anything for us?

interpret} 

% what we learn about AV - galaxy property connection  
While DEMs demonstrate that dust is a major bottleneck for interpreting galaxy
simulations, they also provide some insights into dust. For instance, the
posteriors of DEM parameters in Figure~\ref{fig:abc} reveal consistent trends
among the simulations. In all three simulations, we find significant positive
$M_*$ dependence of $\tau_V$: $\mtaum \sim 2$. Galaxies with higher $M_*$ have
overall higher dust attenuation. 
\ch{how does this compare to the literature?} 
\cite{salim2018} finds the same thing with the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog 2
(GSWLC2) sample for SF galaxies. 


Something about attenuation curves for quiescent galaxies since they are
difficult to get from observations (\ch{why?})
% IR luminosity from AGN can affect IR based attenuation curves(?) we don't
% have this problem since we forward model UV and optical only. 
% even for SED fitting methods \cite{leja2018} find that you have to include an
% AGN model that properly models the MIR emission

% what we learn about delta - galaxy property connection  
We also find overall little $M_*$ and ${\rm SFR}$ dependence in $\delta$. In
fact, the amplitude of $\delta$ is roughly consistent with 0.  
\ch{what does this mean?}
\ch{how does this compare to the literature?} 
This is consistent with \cite{salim2020}, where they measured the attenuation
curve slopes of $23,000$ galaxies from GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog 2
(\ch{cite}).

%restrict to galaxies with moderate to high optical attenuations (AV> 0.5), 

% In brief, at low optical depths, red light is scattered more isotropically and escapes the galaxy, while blue light is more forward- scattered and is subjected to more absorption. This results in a net steepening of the attenuation curve. At high optical depths, in a mixed star-dust geometry, the observed radiation primarily comes from stars at an optical depth less than unity. Redder photons travel more physical distance than bluer photons before absorption or scattering; the net effect is that larger optical depths result in a grayer attenuation curve.

paragraph on restating how we can learn about dust through DEMs based on trends we see
across all simulations. summarize main findings again. 

What are the limitations of DEM and how can it be improved? 
\begin{itemize}
    \item too many luminous galaxies
    \item color distribution isnt' perfect. 
    \item There isn't a whole lot of flexibility for SFR=0 galaxies predicted by
    simulations and they do not agree well with observations \ref{sec:res}. 
\end{itemize}


\ch{How robust are our results?}
We fix the UV bump to reduce the number of parameters. But when run our
analysis without fixing the UV bump, we find it does not impact our results.
We also get no constraints on the UV bump parameters. 

We rely on the slab model. But nothing changes when we use a more flexible
truncated normal distribution in Appendix~\ref{sec:nonslab}. tnorm DEM model allows us to also vary the
scatter of the attenuation curve 

\ch{How about our prior choice?}

\ch{If we marginalize over dust, can we learn anything about galaxy evolution
from the simulation?}

Are there observables that hydro sims + DEMs cannot reproduce? What does that say about the hydro sims?

What observables are unaffected by DEMs? We should chase those observables. 

We clearly have to becareful with overinterpreting hydro sims because modifying
dust allows us to reproduce whatever we want. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Should we bother calibrating our empirical and semi-analytic models
        to hydrodynamic simulations when the hydro sims also require
        marginalizing over dust parameters? Does this mean that if our goal is
        to make realistic mocks, we can be relatively careless about 
\end{itemize}


\ch{What are some applications for DEMs?}
Realistic mock catalogs that reproduce observations in observable-space rather
than physical parameter space.
