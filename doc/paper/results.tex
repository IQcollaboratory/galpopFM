\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
% dust model can reproduce color magnitude relation
Without dust attenuation, all of the hydrodynamical simulations struggle to 
reproduce the $(\gr) - M_r$ and $(\fnuv) - M_r$ relations of SDSS (Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). 
Both in the optical and UV, the simulations predict galaxies significantly bluer
than SDSS galaxies.
The simulations also predict optically blue luminous galaxies with $M_r <
-21.5$ that are not found in the observations; this is particularly
noticeable for SIMBA and TNG. 
Simulated galaxies in SIMBA also have a significantly broader distribution
of $\gr$ colors than SDSS galaxies.
Meanwhile, all of the simulations predict a broader distribution of $\fnuv$  
color than SDSS.
In fact, SIMBA and TNG predict a significant number of luminous galaxies,
$M_r < -22$, with $\fnuv > 2$ colors, which extends beyond SDSS observations.

\emph{With our \eda~prescription, all three simulations produce
color-magnitude relations that are highly consistent with SDSS observations.}
In Figure~\ref{fig:dem}, we present the optical and UV color-magnitude
relations predicted by the 
\eda~for the SIMBA (orange), TNG (blue), and EAGLE (green) simulations. 
For the \eda~parameters, we use the median of the inferred posterior distributions (Figure~\ref{fig:abc}). 
We include the color-magnitude
relations of SDSS observations (black-dashed) comparison. The contours mark 
the $68$ and $95$ percentiles of the distributions. 

Dust dramatically impacts the observables of simulations. 
The \eda~affects the optical and UV color-magnitude relations in three
major ways to produce good agreement with SDSS. 
First, the \eda~significantly reddens the simulated galaxies in the optical: 
$\gr$ colors are ${\gtrsim}0.25~mag$ redder than the optical
color-magnitude relation in Figure~\ref{fig:obs} and match the $\gr$
distribution of SDSS. 
Second, the \eda~significantly reddens non-quiescent ($\log\ssfr > -11$)
galaxies in the UV.  
While quiescent galaxies have intrinsically red UV colors, $\fnuv > 0.5$,
that generally agree with SDSS, the rest of the galaxies are intrinsically
bluer in the UV than observations. 
The \eda~reddens their $\fnuv$ colors by ${\gtrsim}0.5~mag$.
Lastly, the \eda~also attenuates non-quiescent galaxies.
As a result, there are no longer luminous galaxies that are blue in the
optical or UV --- consistent with observations.

Despite the substantial improvement in the color-magnitude relation
agreement with the \eda, there is still one significant discrepancy: the
presence of luminous $M_r > -22$ galaxies that are UV-red $\fnuv > 2$, 
not found in observations. 
This galaxy population, which consists of quiescent galaxies with
$\sfr\lesssim 10^{-2}M_\odot/yr$, is especially pronounced in the UV
color-magnitude of SIMBA but also present in TNG. 
They are also present in the UV color-magnitude predictions without dust
attenuation~(Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). 
\chedit{
    Since these galaxies are the most luminous ones in our sample, dust
    attenuation cannot remove them from the UV color-magnitude relation. 
    Furthermore, dust reddening would only increase the discrepancies with
    observations since they have intrinsic $\fnuv > 2$.
}
In other words, the excess luminous UV-red galaxies predicted by SIMBA and
TNG are irreconcilable even with dust attenuation. 

In order to understand the origin of the luminous UV-red galaxies in SIMBA
(left) and TNG (right), we examine their star formation histories in
Figure~\ref{fig:uv_sfh}.
The top and center panels mark the luminous UV-red galaxies on the optical
and UV color-magnitude relations predicted by the \eda~(red). 
The bottom panels present the median specific SFH (SSFH), $\ssfr$ as a
function of lookback time, $t_{\rm lookback}$, with the shaded regions
representing the 68 percentile of the SSFH.
For comparison, we include the SSFHs of other quiescent galaxies 
($\ssfr < 10^{-11}yr^{-1}$) with matching luminosities, $M_r < -22$ (orange).
The SSFHs reveal that, unlike other quiescent galaxies, the luminous UV-red
galaxies of SIMBA and TNG have  almost no star formation within the last $t_{\rm lookback} \lesssim 2$ Gyr.
With no recent star formation contributing to the SED in $FUV$ wavelength,
these galaxies have faint $FUV$ magnitudes and, thus, high $\fnuv$ color.  
The luminous UV-red galaxies in SIMBA and TNG, which are not found in
observations,

    suggest that star formation quenching is too efficient in the most massive
    queiscent galaxies.

%are a consequence of star formation quenching being too efficient in the most massive quiescent galaxies.

The SSFHs in Figure~\ref{fig:uv_sfh} also reveal that luminous UV-red
galaxies in SIMBA have a substantially different SSFH than other quiescent
galaxies. 
In addition to the lack of recent star formation, the luminous UV-red galaxies
also have significantly shorter star-forming timescales. 
They peak their star formation earlier than other quiescent galaxies at
$t_{\rm lookback}\sim 11$ Gyr and have a more rapid decline in star
formation. 
In contrast, the luminous UV-red galaxies in TNG have overall similar
SSFHs to other quiescent galaxies. 
This difference in SFH suggests that a distinct star formation quenching
mechanism is responsible for the luminous red galaxies in SIMBA. 
In another paper of the IQ series (Choi et al. in prep), we examine this
SFH difference in further detail and present its impact on the quiescent 
fraction evolution over $0 < z < 3$. 

\chedit{
    In principle, the simulations could also remove the luminous UV-red galaxies
    from the sample if star formation quenching in these galaxies was {\em even}
    more efficient. 
    With absolutley no recent star formation, their UV SED would fall below our
    magnitude limit and would not be included in the comparison.  
    However, a large portion of the luminous quiescent galaxies are luminous 
    UV-red galaxies, so the simulations, especially SIMBA, would struggle to
    reproduce the luminous tip of the SDSS red sequence. 
    Furthermore, reducing the total number of massive quiescent galaxies that pass
    the selection function would conflict with our observations, which includes a
    significant number of massive quiescent galaxies (Figure~\ref{fig:sdss_sel}).

%The inferred \eda~parameters for SIMBA also differ significantly from the

%\chedit{
%    We infer the opposite $\ssfr$ dependence for the amplitude and slope of
%    dust attenuation than TNG or EAGLE.
%    These discrepancies are primarily driven by the excess of two galaxy
%    subpopulations in SIMBA. 
%    First, are quiescent galaxies with $\sfr=0$ at $z=0$ and SFHs that peak at
%    $z\sim2$ and fully quenched at $z\sim1$.
%    Unlike other quiescent galaxies in SIMBA, they have had no star formation
%    in the past $\gtrsim 2{\rm Gyr}$.  
%    These galaxies have highly red intrinsic (without dust) UV color:
%    $\fnuv > 2.5{\rm mag}$.
%    While, TNG and EAGLE also have galaxies with $\fnuv > 2.5{\rm mag}$, they
%    do not have high luminosity $M_r > -22$ (Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). 
%    Furthermore, unlike the UV red galaxies in SIMBA, they do not have fully 
%    quenched SFHs with no recent star formation; instead, they have SFHs that
%    are similar to other quiescent galaxies. 
%    The other population that drives the SIMBA discrepancy is the high
%    $\ssfr > 10^{-9.5}yr^{-1}$ ``starburst'' galaxies with
%    $M_*<10^{10}M_\odot$, which lie significantly above the SFS and are {\em
%    only} present in SIMBA (Figure~\ref{fig:smf_msfr}). 
%    This starburst population, which has also been identified in
%    \cite{dave2019} (see their Figures~5 and 6) is caused by excess gas in
%    low-mass galaxies at $z=0$. 
%}

%\chedit{
%    Without dust attenuation, both SIMBA populations strongly disagree with the
%    SDSS color-magnitude relation (Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). 
%    The UV red SIMBA galaxies have $\fnuv > 2.5$ over the entire luminosity
%    range.  
%    This is significantly redder than SDSS, which has only few galaxies with 
%    $\fnuv > 2.5$ and none that are luminous, $M_r > -21.5$.
%    Meanwhile the low mass starbursts have blue $\gr < 0.25$ and 
%    $-20 < M_r < -21$. 
%    This is significantly bluer than the SDSS $\gr \gtrsim 0.4$ limit and also
%    bluer than the SF galaxies in TNG and EAGLE. 
%    In order to reconcile these differences between SIMBA and SDSS, the
%    \eda~prescription imposes a steep attenuation curve with significant UV
%    attenutaion on the UV red galaxies so that they are excluded by our $M_{\rm
%    FUV}, M_{\rm NUV} < -10$ completeness limit. 
%    On the other hand, the \eda~prescription imposes a shallower attenuation
%    curve with high $A_V$ for the low mass starburst galaxies so that they are
%    excluded by our $M_r < -20$ completeness limit.
%    Despite removing the excess $\fnuv > 2.5$  and $\gr < 0.25$ galaxies, our
%    \eda~prescription, with its linear dependence on $\log M_*$ and $\log\ssfr$
%    struggles to accurately reproduce the SDSS color-magnitude relations. 
%    If we exclude the UV red and $\ssfr > 10^{-9.5}{yr}^{-1}$ starburst galaxies 
%    and run the \eda~for SIMBA using median values of the TNG or EAGLE posteriors 
%    for the \eda~parameters, we find similar level of agreement with SDSS as TNG

% comparison to literature 
Previous works in the literature have also compared simulations with different
dust prescriptions to observations in color-magnitude space. For EAGLE, 
\cite{trayford2015} calculate colors and luminosities with the {\sc Galaxev}
population synthesis models and a two-component screen model for dust. More
recently, \cite{trayford2017} calculated optical colors for EAGLE using {\sc
Skirt}, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code~\citep{camps2015}, to model the
dust. At stellar masses and luminosities comparable to our SDSS sample, both 
\cite{trayford2015} and \cite{trayford2017} produce red sequences bluer than 
in GAMA observations. Also, \cite{trayford2015} predict an excess of luminous 
blue galaxies. Although a detailed comparison is difficult since both works 
compare to different observations, we note that with the \eda, EAGLE is able 
to successfully reproduce the position of the SDSS red sequence and does not 
predict a significant excess of luminous blue galaxies. Also using EAGLE and 
{\sc Skirt}, \cite{baes2019} find that they overestimate the observed cosmic 
SED (CSED) in the UV regime and produce significantly higher $\fnuv$ color 
than GAMA. The \eda~for EAGLE predicts $\fnuv$ in good agreement with SDSS. 
%\cite{baes2019}: EAGLE+SKIRT SED compparison with GAMA Far UV is not attenuated enough. underrestimates optical and NIR
For TNG, \cite{nelson2018} calculate optical colors using a dust model that
includes attenuation due to dense gas birth clouds surrounding young stellar
populations and also due to simulated distribution of neutral gas and metals.
They find bluer red sequence peaks and a narrower blue cloud compared to SDSS.
We find neither of these discrepancies for the TNG+\eda. The \eda~provides a
simpler empirical framework for applying dust attenuation than the dust models
in these works. 
Yet, with its flexibility and low computation cost, we are able to fully
explore our dust parameters and produce optical and UV color-magnitude
relations that are in good agreement with observations.

%star-forming galaxies with higher SFR have higher attenuation; however, this

%observations find no strong $\sfr$ dependence for the star-forming population.

% Kartheik on why dust is hard to constrain for quiescent galaxies: 
%firstly because quiescent galaxies don't have much recent SFR and therefore not much dust (their most recently produced dust has likely happened more than a dust destruction timescale ago), 
% secondly because the continuum for quiescent galaxies is super hard to fit (and break degeneracies with SFH & metallicity), which leads to poor(er) constraints. You could basically think of this in terms of dust/total SNR, which drops sharply for this population.
