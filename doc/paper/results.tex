\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
We present the posterior distributions of the DEM parameters for the SIMBA
(orange), TNG (blue), and EAGLE (green) hydro simulations in
Figure~\ref{fig:abc}. The DEM parameters include $\mtaum$, $\mtaus$, and
$\ctau$, which parameterize the $M_*$ dependence, $\sfr$ dependence, and 
amplitude of $\tau_V$, the $V$-band optical depth. $\tau_V$ dictates the
overall strength of the dust attenuation. They also include $\mdeltam$,
$\mdeltas$, and $\cdelta$, which parameterize the $M_*$ dependence, $\sfr$ dependence,
and amplitude of $\delta$, the slope offset of the attenuation curve
(Section~\ref{sec:dem} and Table~\ref{tab:free_param}). The posteriors 
are derived using ABC (Section~\ref{sec:abc}) and the contours mark the 
$68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence intervals. 

In addition, we present the observables predicted by the DEM with median of the
posteriors for the SIMBA (orange), TNG (blue), and EAGLE (green) simulations 
in Figure~\ref{fig:dem}. We include the SDSS observables for comparison
(black dashed; Section~\ref{sec:obs}). The top panels present the $(G-R) - M_r$ 
color-magnitude relations while the bottom panels present the $(FUV-NUV) - M_r$
relations. Without any dust prescriptions, we found that simulations predict
dramatically different observables than SDSS (Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). 
\ch{something about clear bimodality with the red sequence and blue cloud} 
In contrast, {\em using DEMs we produce $(G-R) - M_r$ and $(FUV-NUV) - M_r$
relations consistent with SDSS for all of the simulations}. 

We examine the observables more closely in Figure~\ref{fig:demcloseup}, where
we present the $G-R$ (left) and $FUV-NUV$ (right) distributions in $M_r$ 
bins for the DEM models of the SIMBA (orange), TNG (blue), and EAGLE (green) 
simulations. The top panels contain galaxies with $-20 > M_r > -21$ and the 
bottom panels contain galaxies with $-21 > M_r > -22.5$. In each panel we 
include the SDSS distributions for comparison (grey shaded). These distributions are 
number densities. The positions of the red sequence and blue cloud in the $G-R$
distributions for the DEM models are consistent with the SDSS distribution. 
They also produce $FUV_NUV$ distributions with peaks consistent with
observations. We also find good agreement in the overall normalization
(number density), especially for the $-20 > M_r > -21$ bin. 

There are also a few discrepancies between the DEM models and SDSS observations. 
First, the red sequence in the observed $G-R$ distribution has a sharp red color 
cut-off.  In contrast, we do not find as sharp of a $G-R$ cut off in the DEM models, 
and find a small fraction of galaxies redder than observations. 
Furthermore, while the DEM models for TNG and EAGLE agree with SDSS, the DEM
model for SIMBA overpredicts blue galaxies. \ch{what do we want to do with
SIMBA?} We also find that the TNG and EAGLE DEM models slightly overpredict 
galaxies in the higher luminosity bin and produce a broader $G-R$ distribution.
Nonetheless, Figure~\ref{fig:demcloseup} demonstrates that overall the DEM
models for SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE produce observables are in good agreement 
with SDSS.

% comparison to literature 
% First EAGLE
Previous works in the literature have also presented models that predict colors
and luminosities for different simulations and dust models and compared them to
observations. For instance, \cite{trayford2015} calculate colors and luminosities 
for $z=0.1$ galaxies using EAGLE with the {\sc GALAXEV} population synthesis models 
and a two-component screen model for dust. Compared to GAMA observations, their
model produces a bluer red sequence and overpredicts luminous blue galaxies~\citep[][Figure
5]{trayford2015}. Although a detailed comparison is difficult since they
compare all galaxies, not just centrals, we note that the DEM models find good
agreement in the positions of the red sequences. Furthermore, for TNG and EAGLE, 
the DEM models do not overpredict blue galaxies. Even for SIMBA, the DEM model
overpredict blue galaxies by a smaller amount.

More recently, \cite{trayford2017} calculated optical colors for the EAGLE simulation using
{\sc SKIRT}, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code~\citep{camps2015}, to model the dust. 
\cite{trayford2017} compares all galaxies so again, we do not include a direct 
comparison. Compared to GAMA, while they find good agreement with observations 
at intermediate masses, $10^{10.5} < M_* < 10^{10.8} M_\odot$, they again find
a bluer red-sequence at $10^{11.2} < M_* < 10^{11.5}$. While we do not present
comparisons in $M_*$ bins, which compare SED derived $M_*$ to the predicted
$M_*$ from simulations, we find that the position of the red sequence in the
DEM models are in good agreement with SDSS even at $M_* > 10^{11.2}$. Our models, 
however, predict an overall broader color distribution at the high mass end. 
Using the same \cite{trayford2017} EAGLE and {\sc SKIRT} framework,
\cite{baes2019} compared the predicted cosmic spectral energy distributions
(CSED) to observations. While this comparison averages over the galaxy
populations, they find the EAGLE-{\sc SKIRT} CSED overestimates the observed
CSED in the UV regime. Moreover, the $FUV-NUV$ color of their CSED is
significantly higher than GAMA $FUV-NUV$. The DEM models on the other hand, 
predict $FUV-NUV$ in good agreement with observations. 

%\cite{baes2019}: EAGLE+SKIRT SED compparison with GAMA Far UV is not attenuated enough. underrestimates optical and NIR
% then TNG
Besides with EAGLE, \cite{nelson2018} calculated optical colors for the
TNG simulations with a dust model that includes attenuation due to dense gas 
birth clouds surrounding young stellar populations and also attenuation due to 
simulated distribution of neutral gas and metals.
Although they compare the color distribution for all galaxies in bins of $M_*$,
so we cannot directly compare to the DEM models, compared to SDSS they find 
bluer red sequence peak position and narrower blue cloud. We find neither of
these discrepancies between the DEM models and SDSS. 
\ch{restatement of how the DEM models have the flexibility to reproduce the
optical and UV color-magnitude relationship.}

The simulations with DEMs predict observables in agreement with observations 
despite the significant differents in the SMFs and $M_*$-SFR relations 
(Figure~\ref{fig:smf_m_sfr}). In other words, the DEM has the 
flexiblity to reproduce observations even when simulations predict galaxy
populations with significantly different physical properties. We emphasize that
the DEM is based on the standard prescriptions for dust attenuation and, thus,
serve as a flexible parameterization within the bounds of our current
understanding of dust in galaxies.

Figures~\ref{fig:dem} and~\ref{fig:demcloseup} highlights two key points. First, any comparison of
simulations must account for dust. Dust entirely changes the predictions of
simulations in observables-space. Without dust, we did not find bimodality in
the color-magnitude relation.
Fortunately, the DEM provides a simple framework
for including dust motivated by attenuation laws and correlations with the
physical properties of galaxies. 
Second, the current limiations in our understanding of dust in galaxies 
significant impedes our ability to understand galaxy formation from simulations. 
To robustly interpret any comparison of simulations, we would need to
marginalize over dust (\emph{e.g.} DEM parameters). Since DEMs can produce
consistent observables for a range of simulations, marginalizing over dust
would leave little constraining power on the subgrid prescriptions (\emph{i.e.}
galaxy physics) of the simulations. 

% what we learn about AV - galaxy property connection  
The DEMs demonstrate that simulations can closely match observations by varying
dust attenuation. They therefore illustrate how dust is a major bottleneck for
directly interpreting galaxy simulations for insights into galaxy formation. In
addition, DEMs also provide some insight into dust. Given our parameterization
(Section~\ref{sec:dem}), it is especially easy to interpret correlation between
dust attenuation and galaxy physical properties. For instance, the posteriors of
DEM parameters in Figure~\ref{fig:abc} reveal a
number of consistent trends across the simulations. In all three simulations, we find significant positive
$M_*$ dependence of $\tau_V$: $\mtaum \sim 2$. Regardless of the underlying
hydro simulations, we find that {\em galaxies with higher $M_*$ have overall higher 
dust attenuation}.

This $M_*$ dependence is consistent with prevoius works in the literature.
The seminal work of \cite{burgarella2005}, for instance, found significant
positive $M_*$ dependence in $FUV$ attenuation in NUV-selected and FIR-selected
samples of \cite{buat2005} and \cite{iglesias-paramo2006}. \cite{garn2010} also
find positive $M_*$ dependence in Balmer decrement-based H$\alpha$ attenuation
in ${\sim}90,000$ SDSS star-forming galaxies. \cite{battisti2016} similarly
find higher Balmer optical depth for higher $M_*$ in ${\sim}10,000$
star-forming galaxies from GALEX and SDSS. Most recently, \cite{salim2018} 
find higher $V$ and $FUV$ attenuation for more masssive star-forming galaxies in the
GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog 2 (GSWLC2). \todo{citation is a bit SDSS heavy.
Anything else in the literature?}

%\ch{SFR dependence of attenuation curves} 
In addition to the $M_*$ dependence, the DEM posteriors also allow us to
examine the correlation bteween dust attenuation and star formation. For TNG
and EAGLE, we infer DEM posteriors with $\mtaus\sim-1$ (Figure~\ref{fig:abc}). 
This means that TNG and EAGLE require higher attenuation for galaxies with
lower SFR --- \ie quiescent galaxies have higher dust attenuation overall.
While previous works that have examined the relationship between dust attenuation
and SFR in observations~\citep[\eg][]{garn2010, reddy2015, battisti2016,
battisti2017}, they focus solely on star-forming galaxies. While they find that
star-forming galaxies with higher SFR have higher attenuation, much of this
trend is driven by the star-forming sequence~\citep[more massive star-forming
galaxies have higher SFR;][]{garn2010, battisti2017}. At fixed $M_*$,
observations find no strong SFR dependence for the SF population. 
%\cite{tress2018} find positive dependence between E(B-V) (color excess) with M* and negative dependence with
%SSFR for 1753 star-forming galaxies within 1.5 < z < 3.  

For SIMBA, unlike for TNG and EAGLE, we infer $\mtaus\sim 3$: galaxies with
higher SFR have higher dust attenuation (Figure~\ref{fig:abc}). In fact, the
attenuation is so high for star-forming galaxies that they populate the red
sequence rather than the blue cloud in the color-magnitude relation. This
extreme SFR dependence in the dust attenuation that results in a contradiction of
established color-SFR relations, is due to the fact that SIMBA predicts a population of
star-forming with exceptionally high SFR, that seemingly lie above the SFS
(Figure~\ref{fig:smf_msfr}). In a SIMBA DEM model with $\mtaus < 0$, these high
SFR galaxies would be high luminosity blue galaxies, not found in observations. 
\ch{If we impose a $\mtaus < 0$ prior for the SIMBA DEM model, we struggle to
reproduce observables consistent with SDSS.} The difference in $\mtaus$ 
among the hydro simulations demonstrates that, in addition to insights on dust
in galaxies, our DEM approach can also highlights differences and limiations among 
simulations. Moreover, it further highlights that dust attenuation can be
adjusted, within priors set by observations, so that any simulation can 
match observations. Given this signifcant discrepancy, we omit SIMBA for the
rest of the discussion.

%For instance, \cite{garn2010} find that SDSS star-forming galaxies with higher
%SFR have higher H$\alpha$ attenuation. \cite{battisti2016} find a consistent
%correlation for the Balmer optical depth of star-forming galaxies in GALEX and SDSS 
%using 10000 SF galaxies GALEX-SDSS. Although at higher redshifts,  
%\cite{reddy2015} also find this correlation among $z{\sim}2$ star-forming galaxies of
%MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field.

%\cite{battisti2017} using 5000 SF galaxies from found little stellar mass dependence in the opposite direction (less attenuation at higher stellar masses). But they have big error bars and only probe up to 9.7
%\cite{reddy2015} SF galaxies from $z\sim2$ MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field survey find strong correlation with SFR. %ionized gas is more reddened relative to the stellar continuum with increasing SFR 

% attenuation curve slope  
In addition to the dependence of $A_V$ on galaxy properties, our results also
shed light on the slope of dust attenuation as well as its correlation with 
galaxy properties. If we measure the slope of the attenuation curve of the DEM
models using the quantity $S = A(3000\AA)/A_V$, which is easier to cosntrain 
observationally, we find that the TNG and EAGLE DEM models both predict
slopes within $2 < S < 5$ and centered around $S\sim 3.5$ (Figure~\ref{fig:slope}).
In comparison, previous observational works that measure dust attenuation in
star-forming galaxies also find slopes within the range $2 < S <
5$~\citep{calzetti2000, burgarella2005, johnson2007, conroy2010, wild2011,
battisti2016, battisti2017}. \cite{leja2017} and \cite{salim2018} find a
broader range of slopes in their galaxy samples, $2 < S < 15$. However,
their galaxies with steeper slopes, $S > 6$, have $A_V < 0.4$, which we are not
in our sample (we discuss this in further detail below). Excluding those
galaxies, we find good agreement. Also for reference, the Small Magellanic Cloud 
and the Milky Way have attenuation slopes $S_{SMC} = 4.8$ and $S_{\rm MW} = 2.8$. 
\ch{The dust attenuation curve slopes predicted by
the TNG and EAGLE DEM models are in excellent overall agreement with observations}. 

%\cite{calzetti2000} find  slopes of $2.3 < S < 2.9$ for low-redshift starburst galaxies, 
%\cite{burgarella2005} find $2.5 < S < 6.2$ for 50 UV and 100 IR selected galaxies,
%\cite{johnson2007} find $S\sim2.5$ for 1000 nearby galaxies, 
%\cite{conroy2010} find $S\sim4.5$ for 3400 $10^{9.5} < M_* < 10^{10} M_\odot$ disk galaxies,
%\cite{wild2011} find $2.5 < S < 4.5$ for 23,000 $z{\sim}0.07$ star-forming galaxies, 
%\cite{battisti2016, battisti2017} find slopes consistent with Calzetti (S=2.4) for SF galaxies

%\cite{kriek2013}  using stacked SEDs of medium- and broadband photometry of
%galaxies at 0.5 < z < 2 find an average slope of delta=-0.2  but they restrict
%to galaxies with moderate to high optical attenuations (AV> 0.5), 
%\cite{salmon2016} is also spot on. 

In addition to the amplitude, we can also examine the correlation between
attenuation curve slopes and galaxy properties. For TNG and EAGLE, we find
little $M_*$ and $\sfr$ dependence in $\delta$: both $\mdeltam$ and $\mdeltas$
are consistent with 0. To date most observational works do not examine the
correlation between slope and galaxy properties and have been limited to
star-forming galaxies. \cite{leja2017} recently measured the slope of the 
attenuation curves of galaxies, some of which are non-star-forming. However,
with only 129 galaxies the trends are difficult to meaningfully interpret.
More recently, \cite{salim2018} measured attenuation curves of $23,000$ 
galaxies from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog 2~\cite{salim2019}. While they
also mainly focus on star-forming galaxies, \cite{salim2018} also they find 
that quiescent galaxies have significantly steeper curves. This is in
disagreement with our $\mdeltas\sim0$; however, we note that \cite{salim2018} 
also find significantly steeper curves for the starburst population 
(galaxies above the SFS). Since the DEM model only includes a linear dependence
on SFR, its hard to tell. Furthermore, for star-forming galaxies,
\cite{salim2018} find a significant $M_*$ dependence on $\delta$, unlike our
$\mdeltam\sim0$ constraint. They find, however, this dependence is actually a
result of the underlying trend between slope and $A_V$.

\ch{$A_V - \delta$ relation}
Physical reason why we expect this relation.%Salmon+(2016): Chevallard et al. (2013) predicted the relation between δ and attenuation optical depth at all orientations, assuming only Milky-Way type dust grains. Their model predicted a relationship between the shape of the extinction law (here parameterized by δ) and the dust-attenuation optical depth. We consider this relationship in two scenarios: small and large dust- attenuation optical depths, τ, where the optical depth is related to the color excess by τλ = 0.92 kλ E(B − V ).
% (Charlot & Fall 2000)
% \cite{chevallard2013} provide the following physical picture for this correlation. The steepness of an attenuation curve at small optical depths is the result of the dominance of scattering over absorption, coupled with the fact that scattering is more forward directed at shorter wavelengths whereas it is more isotropic at longer wavelengths. As the optical depth increases, absorption becomes more dominant than scattering, and the curve becomes shallower (grayer).
\cite{leja2017, salim2018} both find a $A_V - \delta$ relation below
\cite{chevallard2013}, which is consistent with us. 
We're also in good agreement with \cite{witt2000} and \cite{salmon2016}

%Overall simulations predict shallower slopes \citep{inoue2005, chevallard2013, narayanan2018} 
%\cite{chevallard2013} radiative transfer models combined with realistic dust geometries and the two-component (birth clouds/diffuse ISM) model




% Both Leja et al. (2017) and Salim et al. (2018) find a strong relationship between the optical opacity and curve slope, such that the galaxies with higher AV have shallower slopes.



% In brief, at low optical depths, red light is scattered more isotropically and escapes the galaxy, while blue light is more forward- scattered and is subjected to more absorption. This results in a net steepening of the attenuation curve. At high optical depths, in a mixed star-dust geometry, the observed radiation primarily comes from stars at an optical depth less than unity. Redder photons travel more physical distance than bluer photons before absorption or scattering; the net effect is that larger optical depths result in a grayer attenuation curve.

dust attenuation in quiescent galaxies, which is difficult to measure from
observations. For non-star-forming galaxies, MIR emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN)
heating nearby dust complicate methods that rely on IR luminosity to measure
dust attenuation. Even SED fitting methods require accounting for AGN MIR 
emission~\citep{salim2016, leja2018, salim2018}. 
Since we utilize a forward modeling approach with optical and UV data, we don't
have this issue. 
\ch{what do we learn about quiescent galaxy attenuation?} 

%\cite{salim2018}: The IR luminosities of AGN may be affected by nonstellar dust heating, especially since they are based on the mid-IR data.

%\cite{leja2017} Inferring total IR luminosities with only MIR broadband photometry can be strongly affected by galaxy-to- galaxy variability in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in the MIR (Draine et al. 2007) and by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) contribution (Kirkpatrick et al. 2015). The interpretation of LIR itself is complicated by the contribution of evolved stars to the IR luminosity (Cortese et al. 2008; Hayward et al. 2014; Utomo et al. 2014). UV luminosities are sensitive to stellar metallicity and recent SFH, and very sensitive to the amount of dust attenuation, which can be estimated from the UV slope β but with serious limitations (Viaene et al. 2016).
%\cite{leja2018}:  Full SED models will naively attribute AGN emission to dust heated by star formation, resulting in full SED models overestimating sSFRs by up to 0.6 dex for galaxies with AGN (Salim et al. 2016)

% For comparison methods, IR lumninosity from AGN can affect IR based attenuation curves~\citep{cite}. Even for SED
%\cite{salim2018} does look at attenuatiion for quiesscent 


\ch{limitations of DEM and potential improvements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item too many luminous galaxies
    \item color distribution isnt' perfect. 
    \item There isn't a whole lot of flexibility for SFR=0 galaxies predicted by
    simulations and they do not agree well with observations \ref{sec:res}. 
\end{itemize}


\ch{How robust are our results?}
We fix the UV bump to reduce the number of parameters. But when run our
analysis without fixing the UV bump, we find it does not impact our results.
We also get no constraints on the UV bump parameters. 

We rely on the slab model. But nothing changes when we use a more flexible
truncated normal distribution in Appendix~\ref{sec:nonslab}. tnorm DEM model allows us to also vary the
scatter of the attenuation curve 

% how does the slab model actually do compared to observations?

\cite{battisti2017a} find a trend between inclination and slope...

% Salmon+(2016): There is evidence that galaxy inclination correlates with the strength of Lyα emission, such that we observe less Lyα equivalent width for more edge-on galaxies (Charlot & Fall 1993; Laursen & Sommer-Larsen 2007; Yajima et al. 2012; Verhamme et al. 2012; U et al. 2015)
% Therefore, based on physi- cal models, one expects that galaxies with “greyer” dust laws and larger overall attenuation should have higher inclinations

Are there observables that hydro sims + DEMs cannot reproduce? What does that say about the hydro sims?

What observables are unaffected by DEMs? We should chase those observables. 

We clearly have to becareful with overinterpreting hydro sims because modifying
dust allows us to reproduce whatever we want. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Should we bother calibrating our empirical and semi-analytic models

        marginalizing over dust parameters? Does this mean that if our goal is
