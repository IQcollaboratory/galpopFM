\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
% dust model can reproduce color magnitude relation
Without dust attenuation, all of the hydrodynamical simulations struggle to 
reproduce the $(\gr) - M_r$ and $(\fnuv) - M_r$ relations of SDSS (Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). 
In the optical, the simulations predict significantly bluer colors and find  
broader differences in color, ${\sim}0.5~mag$, between star-forming and
quiescent galaxies. In the UV, they predict quiescent galaxies with $\ssfr <
10^{-12}yr^{-1}$ that have redder $\fnuv$ colors beyond SDSS observations. 
Meanwhile, for the rest of the galaxies, the simulations predict significantly
bluer UV colors than SDSS. 

\emph{With our \eda~prescription, however, all three simulations reproduce the
color-magnitude relations of SDSS observations.} In Figure~\ref{fig:dem}, 
we present the optical and UV color-magnitude relations predicted by the 
\eda~for the SIMBA (orange), TNG (blue), and EAGLE (green) simulations. 
For the \eda~parameters, we use the median of the posterior distributions 
inferred using ABC (Figure~\ref{fig:abc}). We include the color-magnitude
relations of SDSS observations (black-dashed) comparison. The contours mark 
the $68$ and $95$ percentiles of the distributions. 

Dust dramatically impacts the observables of simulations. The \eda~affects the 
the optical and UV color-magnitude relations in three major ways to produce
good agreement with SDSS. 
First, the \eda~significantly reddens simulated galaxies in both the optical
and UV. Overall, $\gr$ colors are ${\sim}0.25~mag$ redder and $\fnuv$ colors
are ${\sim}0.5~mag$ redder. 
Second, the \eda~significantly attenuates (${\sim}0.5~mag$) intrinsically blue
galaxies (\ie~star-forming galaxies with $\log~{\rm SSFR} > -10.5$). As a
result, there are no luminous optically blue galaxies ($M_r < -21$ and $\gr <
0.5$) --- consistent with observations.
Lastly, in the UV, the \eda~attenuates low SSFR quiescent galaxies that are 
intrinsically red in the UV ($\fnuv{\sim}3~mag$) by ${\sim}1~mag$. Thus, unlike in
Figure~\ref{fig:obs}, the UV color-magnitude relations from the \eda~do not
have a significant number of galaxies with high $\fnuv$, in agreement with SDSS.

% SIMBA discrepancy
\chedit{
    For SIMBA, although the \eda~prescription predicts optical and UV
    color-magnitude relations consistent with observations, there are still
    some discrepancies in the color-magnitude relations with SDSS and the
    overall agreement is worse than TNG and EAGLE.
}
SIMBA+\eda~produces a $\gr$ color distribution that is narrower and a $\fnuv$
distribution that is broader than SDSS. The inferred \eda~parameters for SIMBA
also differ significantly from the parameters of TNG and EAGLE
(Figure~\ref{fig:abc}). 
\chedit{
    These discrepancies are primarily driven by the excess of high
    $\log{\rm SSFR} > -9.5$ ``starburst'' galaxies with $M_*<10^{10}M_\odot$
    that lie significantly above the SFS, which are {\em only} present in SIMBA
    (Figure~\ref{fig:smf_msfr}). This starburst population, which has also been
    identified in \cite{dave2019} (see their Figures~5 and 6) is caused by
    excess gas in low-mass galaxies at $z=0$. If we exclude $\log{\rm SSFR} >
    -9.5 {yr}^{-1}$ starburst galaxies and run the \eda~for SIMBA using median 
    values of the TNG and EAGLE posteriors for the \eda~parameters, we find 
    similar level of agreement with SDSS as TNG and EAGLE. 
}

Without dust attenuation, the excess starburst galaxies in SIMBA are blue
$\gr\sim0.1$ and have high luminosity, $M_r < -22$.
\chedit{
    Since such high luminosity blue galaxies do not exist in observations, they
    need to be both strongly attenuated and reddened. In our \eda~prescription,
    dust attenuation and reddening is a linear function of $\log\ssfr$ so it
    cannot strongly attenuate and redden the starburst population in
    particular. Although we can increase the flexibility of our
    \eda~prescription, the attenuation and reddening necessary for the
    starburst galaxies conflict with the attenuation-slope relation
    well-established in observations and
    simulations~\citep{inoue2005,chevallard2013,salim2018,salim2020,trayford2020}.
    The SIMBA starbursts require both high attenuation and steeper slopes but,
    based oo the attenuation-slope relations, galaxies with higher attenuation
    have shallower slopes. We therefore do not explore extending our
    \eda~prescription and focus on the TNG and EAGLE simulations for the rest
    of the paper. 
}

% comparison to literature 
Previous works in the literature have also compared simulations with different
dust prescriptions to observations in color-magnitude space. For EAGLE, 
\cite{trayford2015} calculate colors and luminosities with the {\sc Galaxev}
population synthesis models and a two-component screen model for dust. More
recently, \cite{trayford2017} calculated optical colors for EAGLE using {\sc
Skirt}, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code~\citep{camps2015}, to model the
dust. At stellar masses and luminosities comparable to our SDSS sample, both 
\cite{trayford2015} and \cite{trayford2017} produce red sequences bluer than 
in GAMA observations. Also, \cite{trayford2015} predict an excess of luminous 
blue galaxies. Although a detailed comparison is difficult since both works 
compare to different observations, we note that with the \eda, EAGLE is able 
to successfully reproduce the position of the SDSS red sequence and does not 
predict a significant excess of luminous blue galaxies. Also using EAGLE and 
{\sc Skirt}, \cite{baes2019} find that they overesimtate the observed cosmic 
SED (CSED) in the UV regime and produce significantly higher $\fnuv$ color 
than GAMA. The \eda~predicts $\fnuv$ in good agreement with SDSS. 
%\cite{baes2019}: EAGLE+SKIRT SED compparison with GAMA Far UV is not attenuated enough. underrestimates optical and NIR
For TNG, \cite{nelson2018} calculate optical colors using a dust model that
includes attenuation due to dense gas birth clouds surrounding young stellar
populations and also due to simulated distribution of neutral gas and metals.
They find bluer red sequence peaks and a narrower blue cloud compared to SDSS.
We find neither of these discrepancies for the TNG with the~\eda. The
\eda~is a simpler prescription for applying dust attenuation than the dust
models in these works. Yet, with its flexibility, we are able to produce
optical and UV color-magnitude relations that are in good agreement with
observations. Furthermore, with its low computation costs we were able to fully
explore our dust parameters.

%star-forming galaxies with higher SFR have higher attenuation; however, this
%trend is driven by the $M_*$ dependence since star-forming galaxies lie on

%observations find no strong $\sfr$ dependence for the star-forming population.

% Kartheik on why dust is hard to constrain for quiescent galaxies: 
%firstly because quiescent galaxies don't have much recent SFR and therefore not much dust (their most recently produced dust has likely happened more than a dust destruction timescale ago), 
% secondly because the continuum for quiescent galaxies is super hard to fit (and break degeneracies with SFH & metallicity), which leads to poor(er) constraints. You could basically think of this in terms of dust/total SNR, which drops sharply for this population.
