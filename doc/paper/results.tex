\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
% dust model can reproduce color magnitude relation
Without dust attenuation, all of the hydrodynamical simulations struggle to 
reproduce the $(\gr) - M_r$ and $(\fnuv) - M_r$ relations of SDSS (Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). 
In the optical, the simulations predict significantly bluer colors and find  
broader differences in color, ${\sim}0.5~mag$, between star-forming and
quiescent galaxies. In the UV, they predict quiescent galaxies with $\ssfr <
10^{-12}yr^{-1}$ that have $\fnuv$ colors much redder than SDSS observations. 
Meanwhile, for the rest of the galaxies, the simulations predict significantly
bluer UV colors than SDSS. 

\chedit{
    \emph{With our \eda~prescription, all three simulations produce
    color-magnitude relations much more consistent with SDSS observations.}
}
In Figure~\ref{fig:dem}, we present the optical and UV color-magnitude
relations predicted by the 
\eda~for the SIMBA (orange), TNG (blue), and EAGLE (green) simulations. 
For the \eda~parameters, we use the median of the inferred posterior distributions (Figure~\ref{fig:abc}). 
We include the color-magnitude
relations of SDSS observations (black-dashed) comparison. The contours mark 
the $68$ and $95$ percentiles of the distributions. 

Dust dramatically impacts the observables of simulations. The \eda~affects the 
the optical and UV color-magnitude relations in three major ways to produce
good agreement with SDSS. 
First, the \eda~significantly reddens simulated galaxies in both the optical
and UV. Overall, $\gr$ colors are ${\sim}0.25~mag$ redder and $\fnuv$ colors
are ${\sim}0.5~mag$ redder. 
Second, the \eda~significantly attenuates (${\sim}0.5~mag$) intrinsically blue
galaxies (\ie~star-forming galaxies with $\log~{\rm SSFR} > -10.5$). As a
result, there are no luminous optically blue galaxies ($M_r < -21$ and $\gr <
0.5$) --- consistent with observations.
Lastly, in the UV, the \eda~attenuates low SSFR quiescent galaxies that are 
intrinsically red in the UV ($\fnuv{\sim}3~mag$) by ${\sim}1~mag$. Thus, unlike in
Figure~\ref{fig:obs}, the UV color-magnitude relations from the \eda~do not
have a significant number of galaxies with high $\fnuv$, in agreement with SDSS.

% SIMBA discrepancy
\chedit{
    For SIMBA, although the \eda~prescription significantly improves the
    agreement, it still struggles to reproduce the SDSS color-magnitude relations. 
    The overall agreement is significantly worse than TNG and EAGLE: the median

    $\rho = 3.7\times10^{-3}, 3.2\times10^{-3}$ for TNG and EAGLE while 
    $\rho = 6.6\times10^{-3}$ for SIMBA. 
}
\todo{UPDATE: 
    Moreover, SIMBA+\eda~preoduces a optically bluer red sequence and a much
    broader UV color-magnitude relation. 
}
The inferred \eda~parameters for SIMBA also differ significantly from the
parameters of TNG and EAGLE (Figure~\ref{fig:abc}). 
\chedit{
    We infer the opposite $\ssfr$ dependence for the amplitude and slope of
    dust attenuation than TNG or EAGLE.
    These discrepancies are primarily driven by the excess of two galaxy
    subpopulations in SIMBA. 
    First, are quiescent galaxies with $\sfr=0$ at $z=0$ and SFHs that peak at
    $z\sim2$ and fully quenched at $z\sim1$.
    Unlike other quiescent galaxies in SIMBA, they have had no star formation
    in the past $\gtrssim 2{\rm Gyr}$.  
    These galaxies have highly red intrinsic (without dust) UV color:
    $\fnuv > 2.5{\rm mag}$.
    While, TNG and EAGLE also have galaxies with $\fnuv > 2.5{\rm mag}$, they
    do not have high luminosity $M_r > -22$ (Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). 
    Furthermore, unlike the UV red galaxies in SIMBA, they do not have fully 
    quenched SFHs with no recent star formation; instead, they have SFHs that
    are similar to other quiescent galaxies. 
    The other population that drives the SIMBA discrepancy is the high
    $\ssfr > 10^{-9.5}yr^{-1}$ ``starburst'' galaxies with
    $M_*<10^{10}M_\odot$, which lie significantly above the SFS and are {\em
    only} present in SIMBA (Figure~\ref{fig:smf_msfr}). 
    This starburst population, which has also been identified in
    \cite{dave2019} (see their Figures~5 and 6) is caused by excess gas in
    low-mass galaxies at $z=0$. 
}

\chedit{
    Without dust attenuation, both SIMBA populations strongly disagree with the
    SDSS color-magnitude relation (Figure~\ref{fig:obs}). 
    The UV red SIMBA galaxies have $\fnuv > 2.5$ over the entire luminosity
    range.  
    This is significantly redder than SDSS, which has only few galaxies with 
    $\fnuv > 2.5$ and none that are luminous, $M_r > -21.5$.
    Meanwhile the low mass starbursts have blue $\gr < 0.25$ and 
    $-20 < M_r < -21$. 
    This is significantly bluer than the SDSS $\gr \gtrssim 0.4$ limit and also
    bluer than the SF galaxies in TNG and EAGLE. 
    In order to reconcile these differences between SIMBA and SDSS, the
    \eda~prescription imposes a steep attenuation curve with significant UV
    attenutaion on the UV red galaxies so that they are excluded by our $M_{\rm
    FUV}, M_{\rm NUV} < -10$ completeness limit. 
    On the other hand, the \eda~prescription imposes a shallower attenuation
    curve with high $A_V$ for the low mass starburst galaxies so that they are
    excluded by our $M_r < -20$ completeness limit.
    Despite removing the excess $\fnuv > 2.5$  and $\gr < 0.25$ galaxies, our
    \eda~prescription, with its linear dependence on $\log M_*$ and $\log\ssfr$
    struggles to accurately reproduce the SDSS color-magnitude relations. 
    If we exclude the UV red and $\ssfr > 10^{-9.5}{yr}^{-1}$ starburst galaxies 
    and run the \eda~for SIMBA using median values of the TNG or EAGLE posteriors 
    for the \eda~parameters, we find similar level of agreement with SDSS as TNG 
    and EAGLE. 
}

\chedit{
    The UV red galaxies in SIMBA have distinct SFHs that differ from the SFHs
    of other quiescent galaxies and are not found in TNG and EAGLE.
    In another paper of the IQ series (Choi et al. in prep), we examine this
    SFH difference in further detail and how it impacts the the quiescent fraction
    evolution over $0 < z < 3$. 
    Furthermore, the starburst population in SIMBA is a known discrepancy that
    is also not present in TNG and EAGLE. 
    Since SIMBA has these discrepant populations that dramatically impact the 
    inferred \eda~parameters, we do not explore extending our \eda~prescription
    so that SIMBA may better match the SDSS observations.
    We instead focus on the TNG and EAGLE simulations for the rest of the paper.

% comparison to literature 
Previous works in the literature have also compared simulations with different
dust prescriptions to observations in color-magnitude space. For EAGLE, 
\cite{trayford2015} calculate colors and luminosities with the {\sc Galaxev}
population synthesis models and a two-component screen model for dust. More
recently, \cite{trayford2017} calculated optical colors for EAGLE using {\sc
Skirt}, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code~\citep{camps2015}, to model the
dust. At stellar masses and luminosities comparable to our SDSS sample, both 
\cite{trayford2015} and \cite{trayford2017} produce red sequences bluer than 
in GAMA observations. Also, \cite{trayford2015} predict an excess of luminous 
blue galaxies. Although a detailed comparison is difficult since both works 
compare to different observations, we note that with the \eda, EAGLE is able 
to successfully reproduce the position of the SDSS red sequence and does not 
predict a significant excess of luminous blue galaxies. Also using EAGLE and 
{\sc Skirt}, \cite{baes2019} find that they overestimtate the observed cosmic 
SED (CSED) in the UV regime and produce significantly higher $\fnuv$ color 
than GAMA. The \eda~for TNG and EAGLE predict $\fnuv$ in good agreement with
SDSS. 
%\cite{baes2019}: EAGLE+SKIRT SED compparison with GAMA Far UV is not attenuated enough. underrestimates optical and NIR
For TNG, \cite{nelson2018} calculate optical colors using a dust model that
includes attenuation due to dense gas birth clouds surrounding young stellar
populations and also due to simulated distribution of neutral gas and metals.
They find bluer red sequence peaks and a narrower blue cloud compared to SDSS.
We find neither of these discrepancies for the TNG+\eda. The \eda~provides a
simpler empirical framework for applying dust attenuation than the dust models
in these works. Yet, with its flexibility, we are able to produce optical and
UV color-magnitude relations that are in good agreement with observations.
Furthermore, with its low computation costs we were able to fully
explore our dust parameters. 
%better agreement than observations than these works.

%They find that
%star-forming galaxies with higher SFR have higher attenuation; however, this
%trend is driven by the $M_*$ dependence since star-forming galaxies lie on 
%the star-forming sequence~\citep{garn2010, battisti2017}. At fixed $M_*$,
%observations find no strong $\sfr$ dependence for the star-forming population. 
%Since previous works do not include quiescent galaxies, %\cite{tress2018} find positive dependence between E(B-V) (color excess) with M* and negative dependence with
%SSFR for 1753 star-forming galaxies within 1.5 < z < 3.  

%For instance, \cite{garn2010} find that SDSS star-forming galaxies with higher

%\cite{reddy2015} also find this correlation among $z{\sim}2$ star-forming galaxies of

% Kartheik on why dust is hard to constrain for quiescent galaxies: 
%firstly because quiescent galaxies don't have much recent SFR and therefore not much dust (their most recently produced dust has likely happened more than a dust destruction timescale ago), 
% secondly because the continuum for quiescent galaxies is super hard to fit (and break degeneracies with SFH & metallicity), which leads to poor(er) constraints. You could basically think of this in terms of dust/total SNR, which drops sharply for this population.
