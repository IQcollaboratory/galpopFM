\section{Summary}
In this work, we present the DEM, an empirical framework for including dust
attenuation in simulated galaxy populations. It uses a parameterization of 
the attenuation curves motivated from observations~\citep[][]{noll2009} and a
flexible method for sampling the attenuation curve parameters that includes
correlations with galaxy properties ($M_*$ and $\sfr$). We apply the DEM to 
three state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations (SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE) and
forward model the optical and UV color-magnitude relations. Afterwards, we
compare these forward modeled simulations to observed central galaxies in SDSS
using simulation-based inference. From the constraints on the DEM parameters,
we find the following results: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Dust attenuation is essential for simulations to reproduce observations.
With the DEM, we are able to reproduce SDSS observations for all three
hydrodynamical simulations. However, based on the inferred DEM parameter posteriors, SIMBA requires an
extreme dust attenuation that reverses the established relationship between
color and $\sfr$ because it overpredicts a large starburst population at
$<10^{10}M_\odot$.
\item Focusing on the DEM for TNG and EAGLE, we find significant $M_*$ and
$\sfr$ dependences in $A_V$. More massive galaxies have higher dust
attenuation; galaxies with lower $\sfr$ have  higher dust attenuation. 
\item The DEM attenuation curves are in good agreement with major observational 
constraints. They closely reproduce the observed attenuation--slope relation,
better than radiative transfer models. We also find significant variation in 
the attenuation curves as in observations. For star-forming galaxies, the DEM
atteunation curves are in good agreement with the literature.  
\item Lastly, the DEM is able to constrain the attenuation curves of quiescent
galaxies, which are poorly constrained by observations. We find that quiescent
galaxies have shallower attenuation curves with higher $A_V$ than star-forming
galaxies. 
\end{itemize}

Our results clearly demonstrate that the DEM can be used to provide insight
into dust attenuation. In this work, we are limited by the completeness limit
of the SDSS central galaxies. Upcoming surveys such as the Bright Galaxy Survey
of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument~\citep[DESI;][\ch{Ruiz\etal2020}](desicollaboration2016), the Galaxy
Evolution Survey of the Prime Focus
Spectrograph~\citep[PFS;][]{takada2014,tamura2016}, and the Wide-Area VISTA
Extragalactic Survey~\citep[WAVES;][]{driver2016, driver2019} will provide
more statistically powerful observations at higher redshifts. With these
observations, the DEM will be able to tightly constrain and reveal new 
insights into dust attenuation. 

For those uninterested in dust, the DEM also provides a straightforward framework 
for marginalizing over dust. Although accounting for dust is necessy to reproduce 
observations, our current understanding of dust there broad enough that even 
simulations that predict galaxy populations with significantly different physical properties can
reproduce the same observable. Since varying dust alone can entirely reproduce 
observations, dust is highly degenerate with the variations in subgrid physics 
across simulations. After marginalizing over dust, observations do not have the
constraining power to differentiate between the various hydrodyanmical models.
Hence, detailed comparisons across simulations and to observations likely 
overinterpret the differences and similarities found in simulations. Therefore, 
we demonstrate that the current limitations in our understanding of dust is a 
major bottleneck for investigating galaxy formation using simulations.
