\section{Summary}
In this work, we present the \eda, a framework for statistically applying dust
attenuation to simulated galaxy populations. It uses a parameterization of 
the attenuation curves motivated from observations~\citep{noll2009} and
assigns attenuation curves to simulated galaxies based on their physical properties ($M_*$ and SSFR).
We apply the \eda~to 
three state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations (SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE) and
forward model the optical and UV color-magnitude relations. We then compare
the forward modeled simulations to a $M_r < -20$ complete SDSS galaxy sample  
using likelihood-free inference. Based on this comparison, we find the
following results: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dust attenuation is essential for simulations to reproduce observations.
        Without dust attenuation, all of the hydrodynamical simulations struggle
        to reproduce the observed UV and optical color-magnitude relation. 
    \item With the \eda, the TNG and EAGLE simulations are able to produce UV and
        optical color-magnitude relations in good agreement with SDSS observations. 
        SIMBA, however, overpredicts a substantial population of low mass high
        SFR galaxies. In order for SIMBA to reproduce SDSS, these galaxies require
        both high attenuation and reddening, which goes against the observed 
        attenuation-slope relation. 
    \item The attenuation curves predicted by the \eda~for TNG and EAGLE are in
        excellent agreement with the observed attenuation-slope
        relation. They also closely reproduce the observed attenuation curves
        of star-forming galaxies. The success of the \eda~in reproducing these
        observations, which were not included in the comparison, demonstrates
        the robustness of the \eda~framework. 
    \item Lastly, with the \eda~we find that simulated quiescent galaxies
        require significant UV and optical attenuation with shallow attenuation
        curves. This sheds light on dust attenuation in quiescent galaxies,
        which remains poorly understood due to observational challenges. 
        For all galaxies, we find that more massive galaxies have higher overall dust
        attenuation while galaxies with higher SSFR have steeper attenuation
        curves. 
\end{itemize}

Our results clearly demonstrate that the \eda~and a forward modeling approach
provides key insights into dust attenuation. For those uninterested in dust,
the \eda~also provides a computationally feasible framework for marginalizing
over dust when comparing simulations to observations. In the case of SIMBA, we
found that the \eda~dust
attenuation is insufficient to accurately reproduce observations due to its 
excess starburst population. For TNG and EAGLE, however, dust attenuation is highly
degenerate with differences in their galaxy physics
prescriptions. Even though TNG and EAGLE predict galaxy populations with
significantly different physical properties, there is enough uncertainty in our
understanding of dust that by adjusting attenuation alone both TNG and EAGLE
can reproduce the same SDSS observations. This also suggests that any
comparisons across simulations must marginalize over dust attenuation or run 
the risk of overinterpretation. Therefore, our current understanding of dust,
or lack of, limit
our ability to distinguish between the various hydrodynamical models and is a
major bottleneck for investigating galaxy formation using simulations.

The forward modeling approach we present offers many avenues for improving on
our understanding of dust. In this paper, we used a restrictive 
$M_r$ complete SDSS galaxy sample. Comparison to a larger observed galaxy
sample will place tighter constraints on \eda~parameters and enable better
differentiation between the simulations. One way to expand the observed galaxy
sample would be to remove the $M_r$ completeness limit by including the
selection function to our forward model. Upcoming surveys, such as the DESI
Bright Galaxy Survey and the PFS Galaxy Evolution Survey, will also soon
provide much larger observational galaxy samples. Furthermore, IR observations, which measure
dust emission and trace dust attenuation, also have the potential to tightly 
constrain the \eda~parameters and therefore break degeneracies between dust
and the galaxy physics in simulations. 
\ch{
    In the next paper of the series, we will use the forward modeling approach
    with the \eda~to investigate star formation quenching in galaxy formation
    models.

In other future works, we will apply the
\eda~and a forward modeling approach to more statistically powerful samples and
include IR observables in order to tightly constrain and reveal new insights 
into dust attenuation.
