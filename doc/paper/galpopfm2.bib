  abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the \textasciitilde 2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120\textdegree{} long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

  abstract = {Non-parametric morphology measures are a powerful tool for identifying  galaxy mergers at low redshifts. We employ cosmological zoom simulations using Gizmo with the Mufasa feedback scheme, post-processed using 3D dust radiative transfer into mock observations, to study whether common morphological measures Gini G, M20, concentration C, and asymmetry A are effective at identifying major galaxy mergers at z \textasciitilde{} 2 - 4, i.e. "Cosmic Noon". Our zoom suite covers galaxies with 10\^8.6 {$<$} M\_* {$<$} 10\^11 M\_sun at z \textasciitilde{} 2, and broadly reproduces key global galaxy observations. Our primary result is that these morphological measures are unable to robustly pick out galaxies currently undergoing mergers during Cosmic Noon, typically performing no better than a random guess. This improves only marginally if we consider whether galaxies have undergone a merger within the last Gyr. When also considering minor mergers, galaxies display no trend of moving towards the merger regime with increasing merger ratio. From z = 4 -{$>$} 2, galaxies move from the non-merger towards the merger regime in all statistics, but this is primarily an effect of mass: Above a given noise level, higher mass galaxies display a more complex outer morphology induced by their clustered environment. We conclude that during Cosmic Noon, these morphological statistics are of limited value in identifying galaxy mergers.},

This paper describes the first data release of SDSS-III (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the SDSS). The release includes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg2 in the southern Galactic cap, bringing the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg2, or over a third of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been reprocessed with an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometric recalibration and flat-field determination. This release also includes all data from the second phase of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars at both high and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million stellar spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed through an improved stellar parameter pipeline, which has better determination of metallicity for high-metallicity stars.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference is often used in cosmology and astrophysics to derive constraints on model parameters from observations. This approach relies on the ability to compute the likelihood of the data given a choice of model parameters. In many practical situations, the likelihood function may however be unavailable or intractable due to non-gaussian errors, non-linear measurements processes, or complex data formats such as catalogs and maps. In these cases, the simulation of mock data sets can often be made through forward modeling. We discuss how Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) can be used in these cases to derive an approximation to the posterior constraints using simulated data sets. This technique relies on the sampling of the parameter set, a distance metric to quantify the difference between the observation and the simulations and summary statistics to compress the information in the data. We first review the principles of ABC and discuss its implementation using a Population Monte-Carlo (PMC) algorithm and the Mahalanobis distance metric. We test the performance of the implementation using a Gaussian toy model. We then apply the ABC technique to the practical case of the calibration of image simulations for wide field cosmological surveys. We find that the ABC analysis is able to provide reliable parameter constraints for this problem and is therefore a promising technique for other applications in cosmology and astrophysics. Our implementation of the ABC PMC method is made available via a public code release.},

  abstract = {Using GALEX, Ultraviolet Optical Telescope (UVOT), and optical photometry, we explore the prevalence and strength of the Ultraviolet (UV) upturn in the spectra of quiescent early-type galaxies in several nearby clusters. Even for galaxies with completely passive optical colours, there is a large spread in vacuum UV colour consistent with almost all having some UV upturn component. Combining GALEX and UVOT data below 3000 \AA, we generate for the first time comparatively detailed UV spectral energy distributions for Coma cluster galaxies. Fitting the UV upturn component with a blackbody, 26 of these show a range of characteristic temperatures (10 000-21 000K) for the UV upturn population. Assuming a single temperature to explain GALEX-optical colours could underestimate the fraction of galaxies with UV upturns and mis-classify some as systems with residual star formation. The UV upturn phenomenon is not an exclusive feature found only in giant galaxies; we identify galaxies with similar (or even bluer) FUV - V colours to the giants with upturns over a range of fainter luminosities. The temperature and strength of the UV upturn are correlated with galaxy mass. Under the plausible hypothesis that the sources of the UV upturn are blue horizontal branch stars, the most likely mechanism for this is the presence of a substantial (between 4 per cent and 20 per cent) Helium-rich (Y {$>$} 0.3) population of stars in these galaxies, potentially formed at z {$\sim$} 4 and certainly at z {$>$} 2; this plausibly sets a lower limit of \{{$\sim$} \} \{0.3- 0.8\} \texttimes{} 10\^\{10\} M{$\odot$} to the in situ stellar mass of {$\sim$}L* galaxies at this redshift.},

  month = jan,
  abstract = {Many statistical models in cosmology can be simulated forwards but have intractable likelihood functions. Likelihood-free inference methods allow us to perform Bayesian inference from these models using only forward simulations, free from any likelihood assumptions or approximations. Likelihood-free inference generically involves simulating mock data and comparing to the observed data; this comparison in data-space suffers from the curse of dimensionality and requires compression of the data to a small number of summary statistics to be tractable. In this paper we use massive optimal data compression to reduce the dimensionality of the data-space to just one number per parameter, providing a natural and optimal framework for summary statistic choice for likelihood-free inference. Secondly, we introduce density estimation likelihood-free inference, which learns a parameterized model for joint distribution of data and parameters, yielding both the parameter posterior and the model evidence. This approach is conceptually simple, requires less tuning than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference and can give high-fidelity posteriors from orders of magnitude fewer forward simulations. As an additional bonus, it enables parameter inference and Bayesian model comparison simultaneously. We demonstrate density estimation likelihood-free inference with massive data compression on an analysis of the joint light-curve analysis supernova data. We show that high-fidelity posterior inference is possible for full-scale cosmological data analyses with as few as \$\textbackslash sim 10\^4\$ simulations, with substantial scope for further improvement, demonstrating the scalability of likelihood-free inference to large and complex cosmological datasets.},

Our sub-grid accretion model captures the key scalings governing angular momentum transport by gravitational torques from galactic scales down to parsec scales, while our kinetic feedback implementation enables the injection of outflows with properties chosen to match observed nuclear outflows (star formation-driven winds are not included to isolate the effects of black hole feedback). We show that `quasar mode' feedback can have a large impact on the thermal properties of the intergalactic medium and the growth of galaxies and massive black holes for kinetic feedback efficiencies as low as 0.1 per cent relative to the bolometric luminosity. None the less, our simulations indicate that the black hole-host scaling relations are only weakly dependent on the effects of black hole feedback on galactic scales, since black hole feedback suppresses the growth of galaxies and massive black holes by a similar amount. In contrast, the rate at which gravitational torques feed the central black hole relative to the host galaxy star formation rate governs the slope and normalization of the black hole-host correlations. Our results suggest that a common gas supply regulated by gravitational torques is the primary driver of the observed co-evolution of black holes and galaxies.},

We compare the observed CSED from the UV to the submm to that computed from the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, post-processed with stellar population synthesis models and including dust radiative transfer using the SKIRT code. The agreement with the data is better than 0.15 dex over the entire wavelength range at redshift \$z=0\$, except at UV wavelengths where the EAGLE model overestimates the observed CSED by up to a factor 2. Global properties of the CSED as inferred from CIGALE fits, such as the stellar mass density, mean star formation density, and mean dust-to-stellar-mass ratio, agree to within better than 20 per cent. At higher redshift, EAGLE increasingly underestimates the CSED at optical-NIR wavelengths with the FIR/submm emissivity underestimated by more than a factor of 5 by redshift \$z=1\$. We believe that these differences are due to a combination of incompleteness of the EAGLE-SKIRT database, the small simulation volume and the consequent lack of luminous galaxies, and our lack of knowledge on the evolution of the characteristics of the interstellar dust in galaxies. The impressive agreement between the simulated and observed CSED at lower \$z\$ confirms that the combination of EAGLE and SKIRT dust processing yields a fairly realistic representation of the local Universe.},

We utilize aperture-matched multiwavelength data available from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to ensure that regions of comparable size in each galaxy are being analyzed. We follow the method of Calzetti et al. and characterize the dust attenuation through the UV power-law index, {$\beta$}, and the dust optical depth, which is quantified using the difference in Balmer emission line optical depth, \{{$\tau$} \}Bl=\{{$\tau$} \}\{\{H\}{$\beta$} \}-\{{$\tau$} \}\{\{H\}{$\alpha$} \}. The observed linear relationship between {$\beta$} and \{{$\tau$} \}Bl is similar to the local starburst relation, but the large scatter ({$\sigma$}int = 0.44) suggests that there is significant variation in the local universe. We derive a selective attenuation curve over the range 1250 \AA{} {$<$} {$\lambda$} {$<$} 8320 \AA{} and find that a single attenuation curve is effective for characterizing the majority of galaxies in our sample. This curve has a slightly lower selective attenuation in the UV compared to previously determined curves. We do not see evidence to suggest that a 2175 \AA{} feature is significant in the average attenuation curve. Significant positive correlations are seen between the amount of UV and optical reddening and galaxy metallicity, mass, star formation rate (SFR), and SFR surface density. This provides a potential tool for gauging attenuation where the stellar population is unresolved, such as at high z.},

The attenuation curves are found to be shallower at UV wavelengths with increasing inclination, whereas the shape at longer wavelengths remains unchanged. The highest inclination subpopulation (b/a{$<$} 0.42) exhibits an NUV excess in its average selective attenuation, which, if interpreted as a 2175 \AA{} feature, is best fit with a bump strength of 17\%-26\% of the MW value. No excess is apparent in the average attenuation curve of lower inclination galaxies. The differential reddening between the stellar continuum and ionized gas is found to decrease with increasing inclination. We find that higher inclination galaxies have slightly higher values of R V , although this is poorly constrained given the uncertainties. We outline possible explanations for these trends within a two component dust model (dense cloud+diffuse dust) and find that they can be naturally explained if carriers of the 2175 \AA{} feature are preferentially destroyed in star-forming regions (UV-bright regions).},

We utilize data from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope and the Two-Micron All Sky Survey, which is combined with previously measured UV-optical data for these galaxies. The average attenuation curve is slightly lower in the far-ultraviolet than in local starburst galaxies by roughly 15\% but appears similar at longer wavelengths with a total-to-selective normalization of \{R\}V=\{3.67\}-0.35+0.44. Under the assumption of energy balance, the total attenuated energy inferred from this curve is found to be broadly consistent with the observed infrared dust emission (\{L\}\{TIR\}) in a small sample of local galaxies for which far-infrared measurements are available. However, the significant scatter in this quantity among the sample may reflect large variations in the attenuation properties of individual galaxies. We also derive the attenuation curve for subpopulations of the main sample, separated according to mean stellar population age (via \{D\}n4000), specific star formation rate, stellar mass, and metallicity, and find that they show only tentative trends with low significance, at least over the range that is probed by our sample. These results indicate that a single curve is reasonable for applications seeking to broadly characterize large samples of galaxies in the local universe, while applications to individual galaxies would yield large uncertainties and is not recommended.},

The photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85\% completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from \textasciitilde 2\% to \textasciitilde 1\%. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.

The particular implementation we present here is suitable for ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations in the redshift range 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.5. Since we base our templates on stellar population synthesis models, the results are intepretable in terms of approximate stellar masses and star-formation histories.

  abstract = {Studying the UV dust attenuation, as well as its relation to other galaxy parameters such as the stellar mass, plays an important role in multi-wavelength research. This work relates the dust attenuation to the stellar mass of star forming galaxies, and its evolution with redshift. A sample of galaxies with an estimate of the dust attenuation computed from the infrared excess was used. The dust attenuation vs. stellar mass data, separated in redshift bins, was modelled by a single parameter linear function, assuming a nonzero constant apparent dust attenuation for low mass galaxies. But the origin of this effect is still to be determined and several possibilities are explored (actual high dust content, variation of the dust-to-metal ratio, variation of the stars-dust geometry). The best-fitting parameter of this model is then used to study the redshift evolution of the cosmic dust attenuation and is found to be in agreement with results from the literature. This work also gives evidence to a redshift evolution of the dust attenuation - stellar mass relationship, as is suggested by recent works in the highest redshift range.},

  abstract = {We present a method that self-consistently tracks the growth of  supermassive black holes (BHs) and the feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. Our model is a substantially modified version of the one introduced by Springel, Di Matteo \& Hernquist implemented in a significantly expanded version of the GADGET III code, which contains new prescriptions for star formation, supernova feedback, radiative cooling and chemodynamics. We simulate the growth of BHs from an initial seed state via Eddington-limited accretion of the surrounding gas, and via mergers with other BHs. Because cosmological simulations at present lack both the resolution and the physics to model the multiphase interstellar medium, they tend to strongly underestimate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate. To allow low-mass BHs to grow, it is therefore necessary to increase the predicted Bondi-Hoyle rates in star-forming gas by large factors, either by explicitly multiplying the accretion rate by a numerical correction factor or by using an unresolved, subgrid model for the gas close to the BH. We explore the physical regimes where the use of such multiplicative factors is reasonable, and through this introduce a new prescription for gas accretion by BHs. Feedback from AGN is modelled by coupling a fraction of the rest-mass energy of the accreted gas thermally into the surrounding medium. We describe the implementation as well as the limitations of the model in detail and motivate all the changes relative to previous work. We demonstrate how general physical considerations can be used to choose many of the parameters of the model and demonstrate that the fiducial model reproduces observational constraints. We employ a large suite of cosmological simulations, in which the parameters of the BH model are varied away from their fiducial values, to investigate the robustness of the predictions for the cosmic star formation history and the redshift zero cosmic BH density, BH scaling relations and galaxy-specific star formation rates. We find that the freedom introduced by the need to increase the predicted accretion rates by hand, the standard procedure in the literature, is the most significant source of uncertainty. Our simulations demonstrate that supermassive BHs are able to regulate their growth by releasing a fixed amount of energy for a given halo mass, independent of the assumed efficiency of AGN feedback, which sets the normalization of the BH scaling relations. Regardless of whether BH seeds are initially placed above or below the BH scaling relations, they grow on to the same scaling relations. AGN feedback efficiently suppresses star formation in high-mass galaxies.},

By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z {$<$} 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* {$>$} 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-\AA break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

These samples are built using the GALEX and IRAS sky surveys over \textasciitilde 600 deg2. The NUV-selected sample contains 95 galaxies detected down to NUV=16 mag (AB system). Eighty-three galaxies in this sample are spiral or irregular, and only two of them are not detected at 60 {$\mu$}m. The FIR-selected sample is built from the IRAS PSCz survey, which is complete down to 0.6 Jy. Among the 163 sources, we select 118 star-forming galaxies that are well measured by IRAS; all but one are detected in NUV, and 14 galaxies are not detected in the far-ultraviolet band (FUV; 1350-1750 \AA, {$\lambda$}mean=1530 \AA ). The dust-to-ultraviolet (NUV and FUV) flux ratio is calibrated to estimate the dust attenuation at both wavelengths. The median value of the attenuation in NUV is found to be \textasciitilde 1 mag for the NUV-selected sample, versus \textasciitilde 2 mag for the FIR-selected one. Within both samples, the dust attenuation is found to correlate with the luminosity of the galaxies. Almost all the NUV-selected galaxies and two-thirds of the FIR-selected sample exhibit a lower dust attenuation than expected from the tight relation found previously for starburst galaxies between dust attenuation and the slope of the ultraviolet continuum. The situation is reversed for the remaining third of the FIR-selected galaxies: their extinction is higher than that deduced from their FUV-NUV color and the relation for starbursts.},

  abstract = {We study two galaxies samples selected in near-ultraviolet (NUV) and in  far-infrared (FIR) for which the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the far-UV (FUV) to the FIR are available. We compared the observed SEDs to modelled SEDs with several star formation histories (SFHs; decaying star formation rate plus burst) and dust attenuation laws (power law + 2175 \AA bump). The Bayesian method allows one to estimate statistically the best parameters by comparing each observed SED to the full set of 82800 models. We reach the conclusion that the UV dust attenuation cannot be estimated correctly from SED analysis if the FIR information is not used. The dispersion is larger than with the FIR data. The distribution is also not symmetrically distributed about zero: there is an overestimation for UV-selected galaxies and an underestimation for FIR-selected galaxies. The output from the analysis process suggests that UV-selected galaxies have attenuation laws in average similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud extinction law while FIR-selected galaxies attenuation laws resemble more the Milky Way extinction law. The dispersion about the average relation in the log (Fdust/FFUV) versus FUV-NUV diagram (once the main relation with FUV - NUV accounted for) is explained by two other parameters: the slope of the attenuation law and the instantaneous birthrate parameters b0 for UV-selected galaxies and the same ones plus the strength of the bump for the FIR-selected galaxies. We propose a recipe to estimate the UV dust attenuation for UV galaxies only (that should only be used whenever the FIR information is not available because the resulting AFUV is poorly defined with an uncertainty of about 0.32): AFUV= 1.4168 (FUV-NUV)2+ 0.3298 (NUV-I)2+ 2.1207 (FUV-NUV) + 2.7465 (NUV-I) + 5.8408.},

Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at {$\lambda>\sptilde$}40 {$\mu$}m. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T\textasciitilde 40-55 K (warm dust) and T\textasciitilde 20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index {$\varepsilon$}=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to \textasciitilde 150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 {$\mu$}m and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 {$\mu$}m is \textasciitilde 1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40\% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 {$\mu$}m is less than 15\% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30\% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of \textasciitilde 2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z{$>\sptilde$}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

Arguments can be given to support the view that Local starbursts are representative of high-redshift (z{$>$}2), UV-detected, star-forming galaxies.

  abstract = {'Approximate Bayesian Computation' (ABC) represents a powerful  methodology for the analysis of complex stochastic systems for which the likelihood of the observed data under an arbitrary set of input parameters may be entirely intractable - the latter condition rendering useless the standard machinery of tractable likelihood-based, Bayesian statistical inference [e.g. conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation]. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of ABC for astronomical model analysis by application to a case study in the morphological transformation of high-redshift galaxies. To this end, we develop, first, a stochastic model for the competing processes of merging and secular evolution in the early Universe, and secondly, through an ABC-based comparison against the observed demographics of massive (Mgal {$>$} 1011 M{$\odot$}) galaxies (at 1.5 {$<$} z {$<$} 3) in the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalatic Legacy Survey (CANDELS)/Extended Groth Strip (EGS) data set we derive posterior probability densities for the key parameters of this model. The 'Sequential Monte Carlo' implementation of ABC exhibited herein, featuring both a self-generating target sequence and self-refining MCMC kernel, is amongst the most efficient of contemporary approaches to this important statistical algorithm. We highlight as well through our chosen case study the value of careful summary statistic selection, and demonstrate two modern strategies for assessment and optimization in this regard. Ultimately, our ABC analysis of the high-redshift morphological mix returns tight constraints on the evolving merger rate in the early Universe and favours major merging (with disc survival or rapid reformation) over secular evolution as the mechanism most responsible for building up the first generation of bulges in early-type discs.},

  abstract = {Parametric models for galaxy star-formation histories (SFHs) are widely used, though they are known to impose strong priors on physical parameters. This has consequences for measurements of the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), star-formation-rate density (SFRD) and star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially declining, lognormal and double power law SFH models using BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that each of these models imposes strong priors on specific star-formation rates (sSFRs), potentially biasing the SFMS, and also imposes a strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that stellar mass, SFR and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry vary with the choice of SFH model by at least 0.1, 0.3 and 0.2 dex respectively. However the biases with respect to the true values depend more on the true SFH shape than the choice of model. We also demonstrate that photometric data cannot discriminate between SFH models, meaning it is important to perform independent tests to find well-motivated priors. We finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey with each model. We demonstrate that our stellar masses and SFRs at redshift, \$z\textbackslash sim0.05\$ are consistent with other analyses. However, our inferred cosmic SFRDs peak at \$z\textbackslash sim0.4\$, approximately 6 Gyr later than direct observations suggest, meaning our mass-weighted ages are significantly underestimated. This makes the use of parametric SFH models for understanding mass assembly in galaxies challenging. In a companion paper we consider non-parametric SFH models.},

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{$>\sptilde$}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc\textasciitilde 0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass {$\sigma\sptilde$}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc\textasciitilde 0.2 Msolar and {$\sigma\sptilde$}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD\textasciitilde n*\textasciitilde 0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {$>\sptilde$}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc\textasciitilde 0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \textasciitilde 1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv\'enic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

  abstract = {We present a new approach to investigate the content and spatial  distribution of dust in structurally unresolved star-forming galaxies from the observed dependence of integrated spectral properties on galaxy inclination. Motivated by the observation that different stellar populations reside in different spatial components of nearby star-forming galaxies, we develop an innovative combination of generic models of radiative transfer in dusty media with a prescription for the spectral evolution of galaxies, via the association of different geometric components of galaxies with stars in different age ranges. We start by showing that a wide range of radiative transfer models all predict a quasi-universal relation between slope of the attenuation curve at any wavelength, from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and V-band attenuation optical depth in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), at all galaxy inclinations. This relation predicts steeper (shallower) dust attenuation curves than both the Calzetti and Milky Way curves at small (large) attenuation optical depths, which implies that geometry and orientation effects have a stronger influence on the shape of the attenuation curve than changes in the optical properties of dust grains. We use our new, combined radiative transfer and spectral evolution model to interpret the observed dependence of the H{$\alpha$}/H{$\beta$} ratio and ugrizYJH attenuation curve on inclination in a sample of about 23 000 nearby star-forming galaxies, which we correct for systematic biases by developing a general method based on importance sampling. From the exploration of the model parameter space by means of a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we measure the central face-on B-band optical depth of this sample to be {$\tau$}B{$\perp$} {$\approx$} 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.2 (corresponding to an angle-averaged \{{$<$} hat\{{$\tau\rbrace\sphat$}ISM\_V{$>$} \_\texttheta{} \}{$\approx$} 0.3). We also quantify the enhanced optical depth towards newly formed stars in their birth clouds, finding this to be significantly larger in galaxies with bulges than in disc-dominated galaxies, while {$\tau$}B{$\perp$} is roughly similar in both cases. This can arise if, for example, galaxies with significant bulges have higher central star formation efficiencies than their disc-dominated counterparts at a fixed specific star formation rate, and dustier stellar birth clouds because of the higher metallicity. We find that over 80 per cent of the attenuation in galaxies in our sample is characteristic of that affecting thin-disc stars in radiative transfer models. The median unattenuated V-band luminosity ratio of thick-disc to thin-disc stars is 0.1-0.2, in good agreement with the results from spatially resolved studies of nearby edge-on disc galaxies. Finally, we show that neglecting the effect of geometry and orientation on attenuation can severely bias the interpretation of galaxy spectral energy distributions, as the impact on broad-band colours can reach up to 0.3-0.4 mag at optical wavelengths and 0.1 mag at near-infrared ones. This paper also contains an original application of Gaussian random processes to extend the wavelength range of dust attenuation curves.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {The stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation histories of galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population synthesis (SPS) techniques. SPS relies on stellar evolution calculations from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries, phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions (IMFs). The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new SPS model. Significant results include the following: 1) including uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z\textasciitilde 0 carry errors of \textasciitilde 0.3 dex at 95\% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z\textasciitilde 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the \textasciitilde 0.6 dex level; 2) either current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase; 3) conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the \textasciitilde 0.4 mag level in the K-band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy populations across time; 4) The more plausible assumption of a distribution of stellar metallicities, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can have significant effects on the interpretation of colors blueward of the V-band.

  abstract = {A novel technique is employed for estimating attenuation curves in  galaxies where only photometry and spectroscopic redshifts are available. This technique provides a powerful measure of particular extinction features such as the UV bump at 2175\AA, which has been observed in environments ranging from the Milky Way to high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Knowledge of the typical strength of the UV bump as a function of environment and redshift is crucial for converting rest-frame UV flux into star formation rates. The UV bump will impart a unique signature as it moves through various filters due to redshifting; its presence can therefore be disentangled from other stellar population effects. The utility of this technique is demonstrated with a large sample of galaxies drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. The observed B - R colour of star-forming galaxies at 0.6 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.4 disfavours the presence of a UV bump as strong as observed in the Milky Way, and instead favours rest-frame UV (1800\AA{} {$<$} {$\lambda$} {$<$} 3000\AA ) attenuation curves similar to the Milky Way without a UV bump, a power law with index {$\delta$} = -0.7, or a form advocated by Calzetti and collaborators. Stronger constraints on the strength of the UV bump in galaxies can be achieved if independent constraints on the V-band optical depth are available.},

Such predictions are frequently compared to the spectral energy distributions of observed galaxies via the stellar population synthesis (SPS) technique. Substantial uncertainties in SPS exist, and yet their relevance to the task of comparing galaxy evolution models to observations has received little attention. In the present work we begin to address this issue by investigating the importance of uncertainties in stellar evolution, the initial stellar mass function (IMF), and dust and interstellar medium (ISM) properties on the translation from models to observations. We demonstrate that these uncertainties translate into substantial uncertainties in the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared colors of synthetic galaxies. Aspects that carry significant uncertainties include the logarithmic slope of the IMF above 1 Msun, dust attenuation law, molecular cloud disruption timescale, clumpiness of the ISM, fraction of unobscured starlight, and treatment of advanced stages of stellar evolution including blue stragglers, the horizontal branch, and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch. The interpretation of the resulting uncertainties in the derived colors is highly non-trivial because many of the uncertainties are likely systematic, and possibly correlated with the physical properties of galaxies. We therefore urge caution when comparing models to observations.},

Four of the simulations follow the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by injecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of galaxies with stellar mass {$\lessequivlnt$} M{$\star$} (the `knee' of the galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from accretion on to their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of observables.},

  abstract = {We present a simple, largely empirical but physically motivated model to  interpret the mid- and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies consistently with the emission at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Our model relies on an existing angle-averaged prescription to compute the absorption of starlight by dust in stellar birth clouds and in the ambient interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies. We compute the spectral energy distribution of the power reradiated by dust in stellar birth clouds as the sum of three components: a component of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); a mid-infrared continuum characterizing the emission from hot grains at temperatures in the range 130-250 K; and a component of grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature in the range 30-60 K. In the ambient ISM, we fix for simplicity the relative proportions of these three components to reproduce the spectral shape of diffuse cirrus emission in the Milky Way, and we include a component of cold grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature in the range 15-25 K. Our model is both simple and versatile enough that it can be used to derive statistical constraints on the star formation histories and dust contents of large samples of galaxies using a wide range of ultraviolet, optical and infrared observations. We illustrate this by deriving median likelihood estimates of the star formation rates, stellar masses, effective dust optical depths, dust masses and relative strengths of different dust components of 66 well-studied nearby star-forming galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS). We explore how the constraints derived in this way depend on the available spectral information. From our analysis of the SINGS sample, we conclude that the mid- and far-infrared colours of galaxies correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate, as well as with other galaxy-wide quantities connected to this parameter, such as the ratio of infrared luminosity between stellar birth clouds and the ambient ISM, the contributions by PAHs and grains in thermal equilibrium to the total infrared emission, and the ratio of dust mass to stellar mass. Our model can be straightforwardly applied to interpret ultraviolet, optical and infrared spectral energy distributions from any galaxy sample.},

  abstract = {Cosmological simulations make use of sub-grid recipes for the implementation of galactic winds driven by massive stars because direct injection of supernova energy in thermal form leads to strong radiative losses, rendering the feedback inefficient. We argue that the main cause of the catastrophic cooling is a mismatch between the mass of the gas in which the energy is injected and the mass of the parent stellar population. Because too much mass is heated, the temperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. We use analytic arguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical resolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected thermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. We then propose and test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimum temperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in both particle-based and grid-based codes. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to test the method on models of isolated disc galaxies in dark matter haloes with total mass 1010 and 1012 h-1 M{$\odot$}. The thermal feedback strongly suppresses the star formation rate and can drive massive, large-scale outflows without the need to turn off radiative cooling temporarily. In accordance with expectations derived from analytic arguments, for sufficiently high resolution the results become insensitive to the imposed temperature jump and also agree with high-resolution simulations employing kinetic feedback.},

  abstract = {The ultraviolet (UV) upturn is characterized by an unexpected up-rise of  the UV flux in quiescent galaxies between the Lyman limit and 2500 \AA. By making use of colour-colour diagrams, one can subdivide UV bright red-sequence galaxies in two groups: UV weak and upturn. With these two groups, we propose a comparison between their stellar population properties with the goal of establishing differences and similarities between them. We make use of propensity score matching to mitigate potential biases between the two samples, by selecting similar objects in terms of redshift and stellar mass. Also, we take advantage of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting results from MAGPHYS made available by the GAMA collaboration. The analyses are made by comparing the distributions from the SED fitting directly, as well as investigating the differences in correlations between their parameters, and finally by using principal component analysis. We explore important differences and similarities between UV weak and upturn galaxies in terms of several parameters, such as: metallicity, age, specific star formation rate, time of last burst of star-formation, to mention a few. Notable differences are those concerning (g - r) colour, metallicity, and time since last burst of star-formation: UV upturn are redder in the optical, more metallic, and their last burst of star-formation happened earlier in time. These differences suggest that UV upturn systems have shorter star-formation histories (i.e. have been evolving more passively) when compared to UV weak galaxies. Consequently, these last seem to have a higher diversity of stellar populations.},

Our fiducial (50 h-1 Mpc)3 volume is evolved to z = 0 with a quarter billion elements. The predicted galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) reproduces observations from z = 4 \textrightarrow{} 0 to {$\lessequivlnt$} 1.2{$\sigma$} in cosmic variance, providing an unprecedented match to this key diagnostic. The cosmic star formation history and stellar mass growth show general agreement with data, with a strong archaeological downsizing trend such that dwarf galaxies form the majority of their stars after z \texttildelow{} 1. We run 25 and 12.5 h-1 Mpc volumes to z = 2 with identical feedback prescriptions, the latter resolving all hydrogen-cooling haloes, and the three runs display fair resolution convergence. The specific star formation rates broadly agree with data at z = 0, but are underpredicted at z \texttildelow{} 2 by a factor of 3, re-emphasizing a longstanding puzzle in galaxy evolution models. We compare runs using MFM and two flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, and show that the GSMF is sensitive to hydrodynamics methodology at the \texttildelow\texttimes 2 level, which is sub-dominant to choices for parametrizing feedback.},

We combine 50, 25 and 12.5 h-1 Mpc boxes with a quarter billion particles each to show that Mufasa broadly reproduces a wide range of relevant observations, including SFR and specific SFR functions, the mass-metallicity relation, H I and H2 fractions, H I (21 cm) and CO luminosity functions, and cosmic gas density evolution. There are mild but significant discrepancies, such as perhaps too many high-SFR galaxies, overly metal-rich and H I-poor galaxies at M* {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2 \texttimes{} 1010 M{$\odot$}, and specific star formation rates that are too low at z \texttildelow{} 1-2. The H I mass function increases by \texttimes 2 out to z \texttildelow{} 1, then steepens to higher redshifts, while the CO luminosity function computed using the Narayanan et al. conversion factor shows a rapid increase of CO-bright galaxies out to z \texttildelow{} 2 in accord with data. {$\Omega$} \_\{H I\} and {$\Omega$}H2 both scale roughly as {$\propto$}(1 + z)0.7 out to z \texttildelow{} 3, comparable to the rise in H I and H2 fractions. Mufasa galaxies with high SFR at a given M* have lower metallicities and higher H I and H2 fractions, following observed trends; we make quantitative predictions for how the fluctuations in the baryon cycle drive correlated scatter around galaxy scaling relations. Most of these trends are well converged with numerical resolution. These successes highlight Mufasa as a viable platform to study many facets of cosmological galaxy evolution.},

  abstract = {We examine the growth and evolution of quenched galaxies in the Mufasa cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include an evolving halo mass-based quenching prescription, with galaxy colours computed accounting for line-of-sight extinction to individual star particles. Mufasa reproduces the observed present-day red sequence quite well, including its slope, amplitude, and scatter. In Mufasa, the red sequence slope is driven entirely by the steep stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation, which independently agrees with observations. High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly onto the red sequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M*{$>$}10\^10.5 Mo. The most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass via dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold inflows more effectively penetrate hot halos. To higher redshifts, the red sequence becomes increasingly contaminated with massive dusty star-forming galaxies; UVJ selection subtly but effectively separates these populations. We then examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems show good agreement with observations out to z\textasciitilde 2, despite not including a rapid early quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched galaxies are far too numerous at z{$<$}1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly over-quenches satellites. A challenge for hydrodynamic simulations is to devise a quenching model that produces enough early massive quenched galaxies and keeps them quenched to z=0, while not being so strong as to over-quench satellites; Mufasa only succeeds at the former.},

To improve over Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementations of ABC, the use of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods has recently been suggested. Most effective SMC algorithms that are currently available for ABC have a computational complexity that is quadratic in the number of Monte Carlo samples (Beaumont et al., Biometrika 86:983\textendash 990, 2009; Peters et al., Technical report, 2008; Toni et al., J.~Roy. Soc. Interface 6:187\textendash 202, 2009) and require the careful choice of simulation parameters. In this article an adaptive SMC algorithm is proposed which admits a computational complexity that is linear in the number of samples and adaptively determines the simulation parameters. We demonstrate our algorithm on a toy example and on a birth-death-mutation model arising in epidemiology.},

Using SDSS as our observational template, we create mock surveys and synthetic spectroscopic and photometric observations of each simulation, adding realistic noise and observational limits. All three simulations show a decrease in the number of quiescent, isolated galaxies in the mass range \$\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_* = 10\^\{9-10\} \textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$, in broad agreement with observations. However, even after accounting for observational and selection biases, none of the simulations reproduce the observed absence of quiescent field galaxies below \$\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_*=10\^\{9\} \textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$. We find that the low mass quiescent populations selected via synthetic observations have consistent quenching timescales, despite apparent variation in the late time star formation histories. The effect of increased numerical resolution is not uniform across simulations and cannot fully mitigate the differences between the simulations and the observations. The framework presented here demonstrates a path towards more robust and accurate comparisons between theoretical simulations and galaxy survey observations, while the quenching threshold serves as a sensitive probe of feedback implementations.},

In total, WAVES will provide a panchromatic legacy dataset of 1.6 million galaxies, firmly linking the very low (z {$<$} 0.1) and intermediate (z 0.8) redshift Universe.},

  abstract = {The treatment of dust attenuation is crucial in order to compare the  predictions of galaxy formation models with multiwavelength observations. Most past studies have used either simple analytic prescriptions or full radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Here, we couple star formation histories and morphologies predicted by the semi-analytic galaxy formation model MORGANA with RT calculations from the spectrophotometric and dust code GRASIL to create a library of galaxy spectral energy distributions from the UV/optical through the far-infrared, and compare the predictions of the RT calculations with analytic prescriptions. We consider a low- and high-redshift sample, as well as an additional library constructed with empirical, non-cosmological star formation histories and simple (pure bulge or disc) morphologies. Based on these libraries, we derive fitting formulae for the effective dust optical depth as a function of galaxy physical properties such as metallicity, gas mass and radius. We show that such fitting formulae can predict the V-band optical depth with a scatter smaller than 0.4 dex for both the low- and high-redshift samples, but there is a large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in the shapes of attenuation curves, probably due to geometrical variations, which our simple recipe does not capture well. However, our new recipe provides a better approximation to the GRASIL results at optical wavelength than standard analytic prescriptions from the literature, particularly at high redshift.},

We measure extinctions directly from the Balmer decrement of each source, and while higher values of extinction are associated with an increase in any of the three parameters, we demonstrate that the fundamental property that governs extinction is stellar mass. After this mass-dependent relationship is removed, there is very little systematic dependence of the residual extinctions with either SFR or metallicity, and no significant improvement is obtained from a more general parametrization. In contrast to this, if either an SFR-dependent or a metallicity-dependent extinction relationship is applied, the residual extinctions show significant trends that correlate with the other parameters. Using the SDSS data, we present a relationship to predict the median dust extinction of a sample of galaxies from its stellar mass, which has a scatter of \textasciitilde 0.3 mag. The relationship was calibrated for H{$\alpha$} emission, but can be more generally applied to radiation emitted at other wavelengths. These results have important applications for studies of high-redshift galaxies, where individual extinction measurements are hard to obtain but stellar mass estimates can be relatively easily estimated from long-wavelength data.},

The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z = 0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z = 7 to 0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z = 4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their haloes for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star formation rates up to z = 8. In addition, we (i) present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z = 5 to 0, for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance in Hubble Space Telescope mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies selected at z = 2 to their z = 0 descendants, and quantify their growth and merger histories, and (iii) track massive z = 0 galaxies to high redshift and study their joint evolution in star formation activity and compactness.

As the impact of dust on UV luminosity can be dramatic, our model includes a self-consistent computation of dust attenuation based on a radiative transfer model. We find that intrinsically brighter galaxies suffer stronger dust attenuation than fainter ones, though the relation has a large scatter. The model predicts galaxies with UV colours consistent with the colour selection regions designed to select LBGs in observational surveys. We find that the drop-out technique that selects LBGs based on two rest-frame UV colours is robust and effective, selecting more than 70 per cent of UV bright galaxies at a given redshift. We investigate the impact on the predicted UV colours of varying selected model parameters. We find that the UV colours are most sensitive to the modelling of dust attenuation and, in particular, to the extinction curve used in the radiative transfer calculation. If we assume a Milky Way dust extinction curve, the predicted UV continuum slopes are, in general, bluer than observed. However, we find that the opposite is true when using the Small Magellanic Cloud dust extinction curve. This demonstrates the strong dependence of UV colours on dust properties and highlights the inadequacy of using the UV continuum slope as a tracer of dust attenuation without any further knowledge of the galaxy inclination or dust characteristics in high-redshift galaxies.},

This combines a semianalytic galaxy formation model based on hierarchical clustering (GALFORM) with a spectrophotometric code that includes dust reprocessing (GRASIL). The former provides the star formation and metal enrichment histories, together with the gas mass and various geometrical parameters, for a representative sample of galaxies formed in different density environments. These quantities, together with a few other assumptions concerning the spatial distribution of dust and its optical properties, allow us to model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies, taking into account stellar emission and also dust extinction (absorption plus scattering) and reemission. In the spectrophotometric code, dust is considered only in the disk, but the general radiation field is contributed by both the disk and the bulge components with their own distinct age and metallicity distributions. Two phases are considered for the dust: molecular cloud complexes, where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellar medium. The model includes both galaxies forming stars quiescently in disks and starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. We test our models against the observed spectrophotometric properties of galaxies in the local universe, assuming a cold dark matter cosmology with {$\Omega$}0=0.3 and {$\Lambda$}0=0.7. The models reproduce fairly well the SEDs of normal spirals and starbursts from the far-UV to the submillimeter and their internal extinction properties. The starbursts follow the observed relationship between the far-IR-to-UV luminosity ratio and the slope of the UV continuum. They also reproduce the observed starburst attenuation law. This result is remarkable because we use a dust mixture that reproduces the Milky Way extinction law. It suggests that the observed attenuation law is closely related to the geometry of the stars and dust. We compute galaxy luminosity functions over a wide range of wavelengths, which turn out to be in good agreement with observational data in the UV (2000 \AA ), in the B and K bands, and in the IR (12-100 {$\mu$}m). Finally, we investigate the reliability of some star formation indicators that are based on the properties of the continuum SEDs of galaxies. The UV continuum turns out to be a poor star formation indicator for our models, while the infrared luminosity is much more reliable.},

Thus, the mechanism(s) responsible for quenching central galaxies plays a crucial role in galaxy evolution as whole. We combine a high resolution cosmological \$N\$-body simulation with observed evolutionary trends of the "star formation main sequence," quiescent fraction, and stellar mass function at \$z {$<$} 1\$ to construct a model that statistically tracks the star formation histories and quenching of central galaxies. Comparing this model to the distribution of central galaxy star formation rates in a group catalog of the SDSS Data Release 7, we constrain the timescales over which physical processes cease star formation in central galaxies. Over the stellar mass range \$10\^\{9.5\}\$ to \$10\^\{11\} \textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$ we infer quenching e-folding times that span \$1.5\$ to \$0.5\textbackslash; \textbackslash mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ with more massive central galaxies quenching faster. For \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\_* = 10\^\{10.5\}\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$, this implies a total migration time of \$\textbackslash sim 4\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyrs\}\$ from the star formation main sequence to quiescence. Compared to satellites, central galaxies take \$\textbackslash sim 2\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{Gyrs\}\$ longer to quench their star formation, suggesting that different mechanisms are responsible for quenching centrals versus satellites. Finally, the central galaxy quenching timescale we infer provides key constraints for proposed star formation quenching mechanisms. Our timescale is generally consistent with gas depletion timescales predicted by quenching through strangulation. However, the exact physical mechanism(s) responsible for this still remain unclear.},

This assumption, in detail, cannot be correct. Likelihood free inferences such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) relax these restrictions and make inference possible without making any assumptions on the likelihood. Instead ABC relies on a forward generative model of the data and a metric for measuring the distance between the model and data. In this work, we demonstrate that ABC is feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark matter halos with galaxies. Using specific implementation of ABC supplemented with Population Monte Carlo importance sampling, a generative forward model using HOD, and a distance metric based on galaxy number density, two-point correlation function, and galaxy group multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock observation generated from selected "true" HOD parameters. The parameter constraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the "true" HOD parameters, demonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter inference in LSS. Furthermore, we compare our ABC constraints to constraints we obtain using a pseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian form with MCMC and find consistent HOD parameter constraints. Ultimately our results suggest that ABC can and should be applied in parameter inference for LSS analyses.},

We find, surprisingly, that the amplitude of the SFS varies by up to{\~ }0.7 dex (factor of{\~ }5) among the simulations with power-law slopes ranging from 0.7 to 1.2. In addition to the SFS, our GMM method also identifies subcomponents in the SFR-stellar mass plane corresponding to starburst, transitioning, and quiescent subpopulations. The hydrodynamic simulations are similarly dominated by SFS and quiescent subpopulations unlike the SC-SAM, which predicts substantial fractions of transitioning and starburst galaxies at stellar masses above and below \{10\}\textsuperscript{10} \{M\}\textsubscript{{$\Sun$} }, respectively. All of the simulations also produce an abundance of low mass quiescent central galaxies in apparent tension with observations.

For summary statistics currently used in LSS, this assumption, even if the underlying density field is Gaussian, cannot be correct in detail. We investigate the impact of this assumption on two recent LSS analyses: the Beutler et al. power spectrum multipole (P{$\mathscr{l}$}) analysis and the Sinha et al. group multiplicity function ({$\zeta$}) analysis. Using non-parametric divergence estimators on mock catalogues originally constructed for covariance matrix estimation, we identify significant non-Gaussianity in both the P{$\mathscr{l}$} and {$\zeta$} likelihoods. We then use Gaussian mixture density estimation and independent component analysis on the same mocks to construct likelihood estimates that approximate the true likelihood better than the Gaussian pseudo-likelihood. Using these likelihood estimates, we accurately estimate the true posterior probability distribution of the Beutler et al. and Sinha et al. parameters. Likelihood non-Gaussianity shifts the f{$\sigma$}8 constraint by -0.44{$\sigma$}, but otherwise does not significantly impact the overall parameter constraints of Beutler et al. For the {$\zeta$} analysis, using the pseudo-likelihood significantly underestimates the uncertainties and biases the constraints of the Sinha et al. halo occupation parameters.

  abstract = {The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum of elliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that this UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars without large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin has remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their envelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf population in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population synthesis model for the FUV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the binary model developed by Han et al. for the formation of hot subdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of observed UV excesses, both in (1550 - V) and (2000 - V), and their evolution with redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic tools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for understanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in general. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as had been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly dependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.},

  abstract = {Galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling is a powerful tool,  but constraining how well it is able to infer the true values for galaxy properties (e.g. the star formation rate) is difficult because independent determinations are often not available. However, galaxy simulations can provide a means of testing SED modelling techniques. Here, we present a numerical experiment in which we apply the SED modelling code MAGPHYS to ultraviolet-millimetre synthetic photometry generated from hydrodynamical simulations of an isolated disc galaxy and a major galaxy merger by performing three-dimensional dust radiative transfer. We compare the properties inferred from the SED modelling with the true values and find that MAGPHYS recovers most physical parameters of the simulated galaxies well. In particular, it recovers consistent parameters irrespective of the viewing angle, with smoothly varying results for neighbouring time steps of the simulation, even though each viewing angle and time step is modelled independently. The notable exception to this rule occurs when we use a Small Magellanic Cloud-type intrinsic dust extinction curve in the radiative transfer calculations. In this case, the two-component dust model used by MAGPHYS is unable to effectively correct for the attenuation of the simulated galaxies, which leads to potentially significant errors (although we obtain only marginally acceptable fits in this case). Overall, our results give confidence in the ability of SED modelling to infer physical properties of galaxies, albeit with some caveats.},

The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both SPH and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume `overlap'. We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity and cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO:1 this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require `artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow, so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages versus SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced `particle noise' and numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, and sharp shock-capturing. Advantages versus non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors and numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of `grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous discs, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize `grid noise'. These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},

We present the FIRE-2 algorithm for coupling mechanical feedback, which can be applied to any hydrodynamics method (e.g. fixed-grid, moving-mesh, and mesh-less methods), and black hole as well as stellar feedback. This algorithm ensures manifest conservation of mass, energy, and momentum, and avoids imprinting 'preferred directions' on the ejecta. We show that it is critical to incorporate both momentum and thermal energy of mechanical ejecta in a self-consistent manner, accounting for SNe cooling radii when they are not resolved. Using idealized simulations of single SNe explosions, we show that the FIRE-2 algorithm, independent of resolution, reproduces converged solutions in both energy and momentum. In contrast, common 'fully-thermal' (energy-dump) or 'fully-kinetic' (particle-kicking) schemes in the literature depend strongly on resolution: when applied at mass resolution \$\textbackslash gtrsim 100\textbackslash,M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, they diverge by orders-of-magnitude from the converged solution. In galaxy-formation simulations, this divergence leads to orders-of-magnitude differences in galaxy properties, unless those models are adjusted in a resolution-dependent way. We show that all models that individually time-resolve SNe converge to the FIRE-2 solution at sufficiently high resolution (\${$<$}100\textbackslash,M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$). However, in both idealized single-SNe simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation simulations, the FIRE-2 algorithm converges much faster than other sub-grid models without re-tuning parameters.},

The dust species are separated into carbonaceous dust and silicate. The evolution of grain size distribution is considered by dividing grain population into large and small grains, which allows us to estimate extinction curves. We examine the dependence of extinction curves on the position, gas density and metallicity in the galaxy, and find that extinction curves are flat at t {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.3 Gyr because stellar dust production dominates the total dust abundance. The 2175 \AA{} bump and far-ultraviolet (FUV) rise become prominent after dust growth by accretion. At t {$\greaterequivlnt$} 3 Gyr, shattering works efficiently in the outer disc and low-density regions, so extinction curves show a very strong 2175 \AA{} bump and steep FUV rise. The extinction curves at t {$\greaterequivlnt$} 3 Gyr are consistent with the Milky Way extinction curve, which implies that we successfully included the necessary dust processes in the model. The outer disc component caused by stellar feedback has an extinction curve with a weaker 2175 \AA{} bump and flatter FUV slope. The strong contribution of carbonaceous dust tends to underproduce the FUV rise in the Small Magellanic Cloud extinction curve, which supports selective loss of small carbonaceous dust in the galaxy. The snapshot at young ages also explains the extinction curves in high-redshift quasars.},

They are built in order to obtain detection at both wavelengths for most of the galaxies. Star formation rate (SFR) estimators based on the UV and FIR emissions are compared. Systematic differences are found between the SFR estimators for individual galaxies based on the NUV fluxes corrected for dust attenuation and on the total IR luminosity. A combined estimator based on NUV and IR luminosities seems to be the best proxy over the whole range of values of SFR. Although both samples present similar average values of the birthrate parameter b, their star-formation-related properties are substantially different: NUV-selected galaxies tend to show larger values of b for lower masses, SFRs, and dust attenuation, supporting previous scenarios of star formation history (SFH). Conversely, about 20\% of the FIR-selected galaxies show high values of b, SFR, and NUV attenuation. These galaxies, most of them being LIRGs and ULIRGs, break down the downsizing picture of SFH; however, their relative contribution per unit volume is small in the local universe. Finally, the cosmic SFR density of the local universe is estimated in a consistent way from the NUV and IR luminosities.},

  abstract = {We investigate the attenuation law seen through an interstellar medium  (ISM) with clumpy spatial distributions of stars and dust. The clumpiness of the dust distribution is introduced by a multiphase ISM model. We solve a set of radiative transfer equations with multiple anisotropic scatterings through the clumpy ISM in a one-dimensional plane-parallel geometry by using the mega-grain approximation, in which dusty clumps are regarded as very large particles (i.e. mega-grains). The clumpiness of the stellar distribution is introduced by the youngest stars embedded in the clumps. We assume a smooth spatial distribution for older stars. The youngest stars are surrounded by denser dusty gas and suffer stronger attenuation than diffuse older stars (i.e. age-selective attenuation). The apparent attenuation law is a composite of the attenuation laws for the clumpy younger stars and for the diffuse older stars with a luminosity weight. In general, the stellar population dominating the luminosity changes from older stars to younger stars as the wavelength decreases. This makes the attenuation law steep; the composite attenuation rapidly increases from small attenuation for older stars at a long wavelength to large attenuation for younger stars at a short wavelength. The resultant attenuation law of normal disc galaxies is expected to be much steeper than that of starburst galaxies observed by Calzetti et al. Finally, the Calzetti attenuation law is regarded as a special case with a large density in our framework.},

To investigate dust absorption and emission in galaxies we have assembled a sample of \textasciitilde 1000 galaxies with UV through IR photometry from GALEX, SDSS, and Spitzer, and optical spectroscopy from SDSS. The ratio of IR to UV emission (IRX) is used to constrain the dust attenuation in galaxies. We use the 4000 \AA{} break as a robust and useful, although coarse, indicator of star formation history (SFH). We examine the relationship between IRX and the UV spectral slope (a common attenuation indicator at high redshift) and find little dependence of the scatter on Dn(4000). We construct average UV through far-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for different ranges of IRX, Dn(4000), and stellar mass (M*) to show the variation of the entire SED with these parameters. When binned simultaneously by IRX, Dn(4000), and M* these SEDs allow us to determine a low-resolution average attenuation curve for different ranges of M*. The attenuation curves thus derived are consistent with a {$\lambda$}-0.7 attenuation law, and we find no significant variations with M*. Finally, we show the relationship between IRX and the global stellar mass surface density and gas-phase metallicity. Among star-forming galaxies we find a strong correlation between IRX and stellar mass surface density, even at constant metallicity, a result that is closely linked to the well-known correlation between IRX and star formation rate.},

There is a long-standing conundrum in interstellar dust studies relating to the discrepancy between the time-scales for dust formation from evolved stars and the apparently more rapid destruction in supernova-generated shock waves. Aims: We re-examine some of the key issues relating to dust evolution and processing in the interstellar medium. Methods: We use recent and new constraints from observations, experiments, modelling and theory to re-evaluate dust formation in the interstellar medium (ISM). Results: We find that the discrepancy between the dust formation and destruction time-scales may not be as significant as has previously been assumed because of the very large uncertainties involved. Conclusions: The derived silicate dust lifetime could be compatible with its injection time-scale, given the inherent uncertainties in the dust lifetime calculation. The apparent need to re-form significant quantities of silicate dust in the tenuous interstellar medium may therefore not be a strong requirement. Carbonaceous matter, on the other hand, appears to be rapidly recycled in the ISM and, in contrast to silicates, there are viable mechanisms for its re-formation in the ISM.},

We derive SFRs and stellar masses by mimicking different observational techniques. We find that the tension between observed and simulated SFR-M{$\star$} relations is largely alleviated if similar methods are used to infer the galaxy properties. We find that relations relying on infrared wavelengths (e.g. 24 \{ {$\mu$} m\}, MIPS - 24, 70, and 160 \{ {$\mu$} m\} or SPIRE - 250, 350, and 500 \{ {$\mu$} m\}) have SFRs that exceed the intrinsic relation by 0.5 dex. Relations that rely on the spectral energy distribution fitting technique underpredict the SFRs at a fixed stellar mass by -0.5 dex at z {$\sim$} 4 but overpredict the measurements by 0.3 dex at z {$\sim$} 1. Relations relying on dust-corrected rest-frame ultraviolet luminosities, are flatter since they overpredict/underpredict SFRs for low/high star-forming objects and yield deviations from the intrinsic relation from 0.10 to -0.13 dex at z {$\sim$} 4. We suggest that the severe tension between different observational studies can be broadly explained by the fact that different groups employ different techniques to infer their SFRs.},

  abstract = {We characterize infrared spectral energy distributions of 343  (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies from z = 0.3-2.8. We diagnose the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) by decomposing individual Spitzer mid-IR spectroscopy into emission from star formation and an AGN-powered continuum; we classify sources as star-forming galaxies (SFGs), AGNs, or composites. Composites comprise 30\% of our sample and are prevalent at faint and bright S24, making them an important source of IR AGN emission. We combine spectroscopy with multiwavelength photometry, including Herschel imaging, to create three libraries of publicly available templates (2-1000 {$\mu$}m). We fit the far-IR emission using a two-temperature modified blackbody to measure cold and warm dust temperatures (Tc and Tw). We find that Tc does not depend on mid-IR classification, while Tw shows a notable increase as the AGN grows more luminous. We measure a quadratic relationship between mid-IR AGN emission and total AGN contribution to LIR. AGNs, composites, and SFGs separate in S8/S3.6 and S250/S24, providing a useful diagnostic for estimating relative amounts of these sources. We estimate that {$>$}40\% of IR-selected samples host an AGN, even at faint selection thresholds (S24 {$>$} 100 {$\mu$}Jy). Our decomposition technique and color diagnostics are relevant given upcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

  abstract = {This Letter utilizes composite spectral energy distributions (SEDs)  constructed from NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey photometry to constrain the dust attenuation curve in 0.5 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.0 galaxies. Based on similarities between the full SED shapes (0.3-8 {$\mu$}m), we have divided galaxies in 32 different spectral classes and stacked their photometry. As each class contains galaxies over a range in redshift, the resulting rest-frame SEDs are well sampled in wavelength and show various spectral features including H{$\alpha$} and the UV dust bump at 2175 \AA. We fit all composite SEDs with flexible stellar population synthesis models, while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and UV bump strengths. The Milky Way and Calzetti law provide poor fits at UV wavelengths for nearly all SEDs. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type. There is a strong correlation between the best-fit dust slope and UV bump strength, with steeper laws having stronger bumps. Moreover, the attenuation curve correlates with specific star formation rate (SFR), with more active galaxies having shallower dust curves and weaker bumps. There is also a weak correlation with inclination. The observed trends can be explained by differences in the dust-to-star geometry, a varying grain size distribution, or a combination of both. Our results have several implications for galaxy evolution studies. First, the assumption of a universal dust model leads to biases in derived galaxy properties. Second, the presence of a dust bump may result in underestimated values for the UV slope, used to correct SFRs of distant galaxies.},

Our central aim is to investigate the occurrence at high redshift of the UV upturn, I.e. the increased UV emission due to old stars observed in massive galaxies and spiral bulges in the local Universe. We use a large ({$\sim$}275 000) sample of z {$\sim$} 0.6 massive (M*/M{$\odot$} {$>$} 11.5) galaxies using both individual spectra and stacks and employ a suite of models including a UV contribution from old populations, spanning various effective temperatures, fuel consumptions and metallicities. We find that a subset of our indices; Mg I, Fe I, and BL3096, are able to differentiate between old and young UV ages. We find evidence for old stars contributing to the UV in massive galaxies, rather than star formation. The data favour models with low/medium upturn temperatures (10 000-25 000 K) consistent with local galaxies, depending on the assumed metallicity, and with a larger fuel (f {$\sim$} 6.5\texttimes{} 10\^\{-2\} \{M\}\_\{{$\odot\rbrace$}). Models with one typical temperature are favoured over models with a temperature range, which would be typical of an extended horizontal branch. Old UV-bright populations are found in the whole galaxy sample (92 per cent), with a mass fraction peaking around 20-30 per cent. Upturn galaxies are massive and have redder colours, in agreement with findings in the local Universe. We find that the upturn phenomenon appears at z {$\sim$} 1 and its frequency increases towards lower redshift, as expected by stellar evolution of low-mass stars. Our findings will help constrain stellar evolution in the exotic UV upturn phase.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {Broadband photometry of galaxies measures an unresolved mix of complex  stellar populations, gas, and dust. Interpreting these data is a challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector- {$\alpha$}, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a six-component nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the parameter space, coupled with Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling within the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model predicts H{$\alpha$} luminosities with a scatter of \texttildelow 0.18 dex and an offset of \texttildelow 0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the H{$\alpha$} luminosity is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon mass fractions, and the age- and metallicity-sensitive features Dn4000 and H{$\delta$}. Although the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses.},

  abstract = {Forward modeling of the full galaxy SED is a powerful technique,  providing self-consistent constraints on stellar ages, dust properties, and metallicities. However, the accuracy of these results is contingent on the accuracy of the model. One significant source of uncertainty is the contribution of obscured AGN, as they are relatively common and can produce substantial mid-IR (MIR) emission. Here we include emission from dusty AGN torii in the Prospector SED-fitting framework, and fit the UV-IR broadband photometry of 129 nearby galaxies. We find that 10\% of the fitted galaxies host an AGN contributing {$>$}10\% of the observed galaxy MIR luminosity. We demonstrate the necessity of this AGN component in the following ways. First, we compare observed spectral features to spectral features predicted from our model fit to the photometry. We find that the AGN component greatly improves predictions for observed H{$\alpha$} and H{$\beta$} luminosities, as well as mid-infrared Akari and Spitzer/IRS spectra. Second, we show that inclusion of the AGN component changes stellar ages and SFRs by up to a factor of 10, and dust attenuations by up to a factor of 2.5. Finally, we show that the strength of our model AGN component correlates with independent AGN indicators, suggesting that these galaxies truly host AGN. Notably, only 46\% of the SED-detected AGN would be detected with a simple MIR color selection. Based on these results, we conclude that SED models which fit MIR data without AGN components are vulnerable to substantial bias in their derived parameters.},

  abstract = {Nonparametric star formation histories (SFHs) have long promised to be the ``gold standard'' for galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling as they are flexible enough to describe the full diversity of SFH shapes, whereas parametric models rule out a significant fraction of these shapes a priori. However, this flexibility is not fully constrained even with high-quality observations, making it critical to choose a well-motivated prior. Here, we use the SED-fitting code Prospector to explore the effect of different nonparametric priors by fitting SFHs to mock UV-IR photometry generated from a diverse set of input SFHs. First, we confirm that nonparametric SFHs recover input SFHs with less bias and return more accurate errors than do parametric SFHs. We further find that, while nonparametric SFHs robustly recover the overall shape of the input SFH, the primary determinant of the size and shape of the posterior star formation rate as a function of time (SFR(t)) is the choice of prior, rather than the photometric noise. As a practical demonstration, we fit the UV-IR photometry of{\~ }6000 galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey and measure scatters between priors to be 0.1 dex in mass, 0.8 dex in SFR\textsubscript{100 Myr}, and 0.2 dex in mass-weighted ages, with the bluest star-forming galaxies showing the most sensitivity. An important distinguishing characteristic for nonparametric models is the characteristic timescale for changes in SFR(t). This difference controls whether galaxies are assembled in bursts or in steady-state star formation, corresponding respectively to (feedback-dominated/accretion-dominated) models of galaxy formation and to (larger/smaller) confidence intervals derived from SED fitting. High-quality spectroscopy has the potential to further distinguish between these proposed models of SFR(t).},

  abstract = {Context. This is the third in a series of papers that develop a new and  flexible model to predict weak-lensing (WL) peak counts, which have been shown to be a very valuable non-Gaussian probe of cosmology.  Aims: In this paper, we compare the cosmological information extracted from WL peak counts using different filtering techniques of the galaxy shear data, including linear filtering with a Gaussian and two compensated filters (the starlet wavelet and the aperture mass), and the nonlinear filtering method MRLens. We present improvements to our model that account for realistic survey conditions, which are masks, shear-to-convergence transformations, and non-constant noise.  Methods: We create simulated peak counts from our stochastic model, from which we obtain constraints on the matter density {$\Omega$}m, the power spectrum normalisation {$\sigma$}8, and the dark-energy parameter w0de. We use two methods for parameter inference, a copula likelihood, and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). We measure the contour width in the {$\Omega$}m-{$\sigma$}8 degeneracy direction and the figure of merit to compare parameter constraints from different filtering techniques. Results: We find that starlet filtering outperforms the Gaussian kernel, and that including peak counts from different smoothing scales helps to lift parameter degeneracies. Peak counts from different smoothing scales with a compensated filter show very little cross-correlation, and adding information from different scales can therefore strongly enhance the available information. Measuring peak counts separately from different scales yields tighter constraints than using a combined peak histogram from a single map that includes multiscale information. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a compensated filter function with counts included separately from different smoothing scales yields the tightest constraints on cosmological parameters from WL peaks.},

These simulations were performed with an enhanced version of the GADGET code that includes a modified hydrodynamics solver, time-step limiter and subgrid treatments of baryonic physics, such as stellar mass loss, element-by-element radiative cooling, star formation and feedback from star formation and black hole accretion. The simulation suite includes runs performed in volumes ranging from 25 to 100 comoving megaparsecs per side, with numerical resolution chosen to marginally resolve the Jeans mass of the gas at the star formation threshold. The free parameters of the subgrid models for feedback are calibrated to the redshift z = 0 galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes and black hole mass-stellar mass relation. The simulations have been shown to match a wide range of observations for present-day and higher-redshift galaxies. The raw particle data have been used to link galaxies across redshifts by creating merger trees. The indexing of the tree produces a simple way to connect a galaxy at one redshift to its progenitors at higher redshift and to identify its descendants at lower redshift. In this paper we present a relational database which we are making available for general use. A large number of properties of haloes and galaxies and their merger trees are stored in the database, including stellar masses, star formation rates, metallicities, photometric measurements and mock gri images. Complex queries can be created to explore the evolution of more than 105 galaxies, examples of which are provided in the Appendix. The relatively good and broad agreement of the simulations with a wide range of observational datasets makes the database an ideal resource for the analysis of model galaxies through time, and for connecting and interpreting observational datasets.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we provide a physical model for the origin of variations in the shapes and bump strengths of dust attenuation laws in galaxies by combining a large suite of cosmological ``zoom-in'' galaxy formation simulations with 3D Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer calculations. We model galaxies over three orders of magnitude in stellar mass, ranging from Milky Way-like systems to massive galaxies at high redshift. Critically, for these calculations, we employ a constant underlying dust extinction law in all cases and examine how the role of geometry and radiative transfer effects impacts the resultant attenuation curves. Our main results follow. Despite our usage of a constant dust extinction curve, we find dramatic variations in the derived attenuation laws. The slopes of normalized attenuation laws depend primarily on the complexities of star-to-dust geometry. Increasing fractions of unobscured young stars flatten normalized curves, while increasing fractions of unobscured old stars steepen curves. Similar to the slopes of our model attenuation laws, we find dramatic variation in the 2175 \AA{} ultraviolet bump strength, including a subset of curves with little to no bump. These bump strengths are primarily influenced by the fraction of unobscured O and B stars in our model, with the impact of scattered light having only a secondary effect. Taken together, these results lead to a natural relationship between the attenuation curve slope and 2175 \AA{} bump strength. Finally, we apply these results to a 25 Mpc h -1 box cosmological hydrodynamic simulation in order to model the expected dispersion in attenuation laws at integer redshifts from z = 0 to 6. A significant dispersion is expected at low redshifts and decreases toward z = 6. We provide tabulated results for the best-fit median attenuation curve at all redshifts.},

We find signatures of the physical process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower star formation rates, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies.

  abstract = {Aims: Photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength  range from far-UV to far-IR make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a high reliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dust emission at the same time. Methods: For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston (or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale \& Helou dust emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes were computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated. Results: For up to 17 filters with effective wavelengths between 0.15 and 160 {$\mu$}m, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 \AA, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. Details of the star formation history (excepting the burst fraction) and the shape of the attenuation curve are difficult to investigate with the available broad-band UV and optical photometric data. A study of the mutual relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a significant drop in this activity at about 1011 M{$\odot$} towards higher total stellar masses. The dustiest galaxies in the SINGS sample are present in the same mass range. On the other hand, the far-UV attenuation of our sample galaxies does not appear to show a significant dependence on star formation activity. Conclusions: The results for our SINGS test sample demonstrate that CIGALE can be a valuable tool for studying basic properties of galaxies in the near and distant Universe if UV-to-IR data are available.},

It is the most variable photometric feature associated with old stellar populations. Recent observational and theoretical evidence shows that it is produced mainly by low-mass, small-envelope, helium-burning stars in extreme horizontal branch and subsequent phases of evolution. These are probably descendants of the dominant, metal rich population of the galaxies. Their lifetime UV outputs are remarkably sensitive to their physical properties and hence to the age and the helium and metal abundances of their parents. UV spectra are therefore exceptionally promising diagnostics of old stellar populations, although their calibration requires a much improved understanding of giant branch mass loss, helium enrichment, and atmospheric diffusion.},

To this inquiry, we extend the graphite-silicate grain model, introduced by Mathis, Rumpl, and Nordsieck and developed by Draine and Lee (1984) from the Milky Way to the Magellanic Clouds. We find that the empirical extinction curves in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds can be reproduced by adjusting only the relative abundances of graphite and silicate grains, while leaving all other model properties fixed to those appropriate for the Galactic extinction curve. Using the graphite-silicate models, we calculate the absorption and scattering optical depths, the mass-density ratio of interstellar dust to neutral hydrogen, and the Kramers-Kronig relation for all three galaxies. We also present a fitting function for the three extinction curves, valid not only over the observed range of wavelengths but also over the full range as predicted by the models. All the quantities we derived here are independent of the dust-to-gas ratios in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, and can be applied to other galaxies if they contain Galactic or Magellanic-type dust.},

The overall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris galaxy formation model, and includes prescriptions for star formation, stellar evolution, chemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line cooling of the gas, stellar feedback with galactic outflows, and black hole formation, growth and multimode feedback. In this paper, we give a comprehensive description of the physical and numerical advances that form the core of the IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation) framework. We focus on the revised implementation of the galactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal content and energy scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population. As described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black-hole-driven kinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics and improvements to the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25 Mpc h-1)3 cosmological boxes, we assess the outcome of the new model at our fiducial resolution. The presence of a self-consistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an important impact on the stellar content of 1012 M{$\odot$} haloes and above. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds promise to solve key problems identified in Illustris in matching observational constraints and affecting the stellar content and sizes of the low-mass end of the galaxy population.},

We include condensation of dust in stellar ejecta, the growth of dust in the interstellar medium (ISM), the destruction of dust by supernovae and in the hot halo, and dusty winds and inflows. The rate of dust growth in the ISM depends on the metallicity and density of molecular clouds. Our fiducial model reproduces the relation between dust mass and stellar mass from z = 0 to z = 7, the number density of galaxies with dust masses less than 108.3 M{$\odot$} and the cosmic density of dust at z = 0. The model accounts for the double power-law trend between dust-to-gas (DTG) ratio and gas-phase metallicity of local galaxies and the relation between DTG ratio and stellar mass. The dominant mode of dust formation is dust growth in the ISM, except for galaxies with M* {$<$} 107 M{$\odot$}, where condensation of dust in supernova ejecta dominates. The dust-to-metal ratio of galaxies depends on the gas-phase metallicity, unlike what is typically assumed in cosmological simulations. Model variants, including higher condensation efficiencies, a fixed time-scale for dust growth in the ISM, or no growth at all reproduce some of the observed constraints, but fail to simultaneously reproduce the shape of dust scaling relations and the dust mass of high-redshift galaxies.},

Our sample consists of 224 star-forming galaxies with zspec = 1.36-2.59 and high signal-to-noise ratio measurements of H{$\alpha$} and H{$\beta$} obtained with Keck/MOSFIRE. We construct composite spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies in bins of Balmer decrement to measure the attenuation curve. We find a curve that is similar to the SMC extinction curve at {$\lambda$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2500 \AA. At shorter wavelengths, the shape is identical to that of the Calzetti et al. relation, but with a lower normalization. Hence, the new attenuation curve results in star formation rates (SFRs) that are {$\approx$} 20\% lower, and stellar masses that are \{{$\Delta$} \}\{log\}(\{M\}*\{/M\}{$\odot$} ){$\simeq$} 0.16 dex lower, than those obtained with the Calzetti relation. We find that the difference in the total attenuation of the ionized gas and stellar continuum correlates strongly with SFR, such that for dust-corrected SFRs {$\greaterequivlnt$} 20 M{$\odot$} yr-1, assuming a Chabrier initial mass function, the nebular emission lines suffer an increasing degree of obscuration relative to the continuum. A simple model that can account for these trends is one in which the UV through optical stellar continuum is dominated by a population of less-reddened stars, while the nebular line and bolometric luminosities become increasingly dominated by dustier stellar populations for galaxies with large SFRs, as a result of the increased dust enrichment that accompanies such galaxies. Consequently, UV- and SED-based SFRs may underestimate the total SFR at even modest levels of {$\approx$}20 M{$\odot$} yr-1. Based on data obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.M.

SUNRISE, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, is used to make detailed calculations of the internal extinction of disc galaxies caused by their dust content. SUNRISE is used on eight different smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated spiral galaxies. These galaxies vary mainly in mass and hence luminosity, spanning a range in luminosities from -16 to -22 mag in the B band. We focus on the attenuation in different wavelength bands as a function of the disc inclination and the luminosity of the models, and compare this to observations. Observations suggest different metallicity gradients for galaxies of different luminosities. These metallicity gradients were explored in our different models, finding that the resulting dust attenuation matches observations for edge-on galaxies, but does not show a linear behaviour in log(axialratio) as some observations have suggested. A quadratic law describing the dependence of attenuation on inclination, as proposed by more recent observations, reconciles the attenuation of the simulations at intermediate inclinations with observations. We also compare the total infrared-to-ultraviolet flux ratios for the simulated galaxies with those of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey sample and find general agreement. Finally, we compare our results with those from simpler models that do not take into account structures such as spiral arms, finding that the inclusion of substructures on the size scale of spiral arms does not change conclusions about the attenuation dependence on inclination or wavelength.},

GSWLC contains galaxies within the Galaxy Evolution Explorer footprint, regardless of a UV detection, covering 90\% of SDSS. The physical properties were obtained from UV/optical spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting following Bayesian methodology of Salim et al., with improvements such as blending corrections for low-resolution UV photometry, flexible dust attenuation laws, and emission-line corrections. GSWLC also includes mid-IR SFRs derived from IR templates based on 22 {$\mu$} \{\{m\}\} Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer observations. These estimates are independent of UV/optical SED fitting, in order to separate possible systematics. The paper argues that the comparison of specific SFRs (sSFRs) is more informative and physically motivated than the comparison of SFRs. The sSFRs resulting from the UV/optical SED fitting are compared to the mid-IR sSFRs and to sSFRs from three published catalogs. For ``main-sequence'' galaxies with no active galactic nucleus (AGN) all sSFRs are in very good agreement (within 0.1 dex on average). In particular, the widely used aperture-corrected SFRs from the MPA/JHU catalog show no systematic offsets, in contrast to some integral field spectroscopy results. For galaxies below the main sequence (log sSFR {$<$} -11), mid-IR (s)SFRs based on fixed luminosity-SFR conversion are severely biased (up to 2 dex) because the dust is primarily heated by old stars. Furthermore, mid-IR (s)SFRs are overestimated by up to 0.6 dex for galaxies with AGNs, presumably due to nonstellar dust heating. UV/optical (s)SFRs are thus preferred to IR-based (s)SFRs for quenched galaxies and those that host AGNs.},

Attenuation curve slopes and UV bump strengths are reasonably well constrained independently from one another. We find that \{A\}{$\lambda$} /\{A\}V attenuation curves exhibit a very wide range of slopes that are on average as steep as the curve slope of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The slope is a strong function of optical opacity. Opaque galaxies have shallower curves\textemdash in agreement with recent radiative transfer models. The dependence of slopes on the opacity produces an apparent dependence on stellar mass: more massive galaxies have shallower slopes. Attenuation curves exhibit a wide range of UV bump amplitudes, from none to Milky Way (MW)-like, with an average strength one-third that of the MW bump. Notably, local analogs of high-redshift galaxies have an average curve that is somewhat steeper than the SMC curve, with a modest UV bump that can be, to first order, ignored, as its effect on the near-UV magnitude is 0.1 mag. Neither the slopes nor the strengths of the UV bump depend on gas-phase metallicity. Functional forms for attenuation laws are presented for normal star-forming galaxies, high-z analogs, and quiescent galaxies.

For each galaxy, we derive, using CIGALE and the spectral energy distribution+LIR fitting technique, the slope of the dust attenuation curve and the strength of the UV bump, plus many other galaxy parameters. We find that the IRX-{$\beta$} scatter is driven entirely by a wide range of attenuation curves\textemdash primarily by their slopes. Once the slope and the UV bump are fixed, the scatter in the IRX-{$\beta$} relation vanishes. The question of the IRX-{$\beta$} scatter is a direct manifestation of the more fundamental question of the diversity of dust attenuation curves. The predominant role of the attenuation curve is the consequence of a narrow range of intrinsic UV slopes of star-forming (SF) galaxies. Galaxies with different specific star formation rates (sSFRs) or population ages do not show strong trends in the IRX-{$\beta$} diagram because their attenuation curves are, on average, similar. Similarly, there is no shift in the IRX-{$\beta$} locus between starbursts and normal SF galaxies, both types having, on average, steep attenuation curves. Optical opacity is identified as the strongest determinant of the attenuation curve slope and consequently of the IRX-{$\beta$} diversity. Despite the scatter, the use of an average IRX-{$\beta$} relation is justified to correct SFRs, adding a random error of {$\lessequivlnt$}0.15 dex. The form of the local correspondence between IRX-{$\beta$} and attenuation curves is maintained at high redshifts as long as the evolution of the intrinsic UV slopes stays within a few tenths.},

  abstract = {Understanding the properties and physical mechanisms that shape dust attenuation curves in galaxies is one of the fundamental questions of extragalactic astrophysics, with a great practical significance for deriving the physical properties of galaxies, such as the star formation rate and stellar mass. Attenuation curves result from a combination of dust grain properties, dust content, and the spatial arrangement of dust and different populations of stars. In this review we assess the current state of the field, paying particular attention to the importance of extinction curves as the building blocks of attenuation laws. We introduce a quantitative framework to characterize and compare extinction and attenuation curves, present a theoretical foundation for interpreting empirical results, overview an array of observational methods, and review the observational state of the field at both low and high redshift. Our main conclusions are: Attenuation curves exhibit a large range of slopes, from curves with shallow (Milky Way-like) slopes to those exceeding the slope of the SMC extinction curve. The slopes of the curves correlate strongly with the effective optical opacities, in the sense that galaxies with low dust column density (lower visual attenuation) tend to have steeper slopes, whereas the galaxies with high dust column density have shallower (grey) slopes. Galaxies appear to exhibit a diverse range of 2175A UV bump strengths, but on average have suppressed bumps compared to the average Milky Way extinction curve. Theoretical studies indicate that variations in bump strength may result from similar geometric and radiative transfer effects that drive the correlation between the slope and the dust column.},

  abstract = {Dust attenuation affects nearly all observational aspects of galaxy evolution, yet very little is known about the form of the dust-attenuation law in the distant Universe. Here, we model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies at z = 1.5--3 from CANDELS with rest-frame UV to near-IR imaging under different assumptions about the dust law, and compare the amount of inferred attenuated light with the observed infrared (IR) luminosities. Some individual galaxies show strong Bayesian evidence in preference of one dust law over another, and this preference agrees with their observed location on the plane of infrared excess (IRX, \$L\_\{\textbackslash text\{TIR\}\}/L\_\{\textbackslash text\{UV\}\}\$) and UV slope (\$\textbackslash beta\$). We generalize the shape of the dust law with an empirical model, \$A\_\{\textbackslash lambda,\textbackslash delta\}=E(B-V)\textbackslash{} k\_\textbackslash lambda\textbackslash{} (\textbackslash lambda/\textbackslash lambda\_V)\^\textbackslash delta\$ where \$k\_\textbackslash lambda\$ is the dust law of Calzetti et al. (2000), and show that there exists a correlation between the color excess \$\{E(B-V)\}\$ and tilt \$\textbackslash delta\$ with \$\{\textbackslash delta=(0.62\textbackslash pm0.05)\textbackslash log(E(B-V))\}\$+ \$\{(0.26\textasciitilde\textbackslash pm\textasciitilde 0.02)\}\$. Galaxies with high color excess have a shallower, starburst-like law, and those with low color excess have a steeper, SMC-like law. Surprisingly, the galaxies in our sample show no correlation between the shape of the dust law and stellar mass, star-formation rate, or \$\textbackslash beta\$. The change in the dust law with color excess is consistent with a model where attenuation is caused by by scattering, a mixed star-dust geometry, and/or trends with stellar population age, metallicity, and dust grain size. This rest-frame UV-to-near-IR method shows potential to constrain the dust law at even higher (\$z{$>$}3\$) redshifts.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies  and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 {$<$} M*/M{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M* {$\greaterequivlnt$} 109 M{$\odot$} (M* {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1010 M{$\odot$} at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {The attenuation of starlight by dust in galactic environments is  investigated through models of radiative transfer in a spherical, clumpy interstellar medium (ISM). We show that the attenuation curves are primarily determined by the wavelength dependence of absorption rather than by the underlying extinction (absorption+scattering) curve; the observationally derived attenuation curves cannot constrain a unique extinction curve unless the absorption or scattering efficiency is specified. Attenuation curves consistent with the ``Calzetti curve'' are found by assuming the silicate-carbonaceous dust model for the Milky Way (MW), but with the 2175 \AA{} bump suppressed or absent. The discrepancy between our results and previous work that claimed the Small Magellanic Cloud dust to be the origin of the Calzetti curve is ascribed to the difference in adopted albedos; we use the theoretically calculated albedos, whereas the previous works adopted albedos derived empirically from observations of reflection nebulae. It is found that the attenuation curves calculated with the MW dust model are well represented by a modified Calzetti curve with a varying slope and UV bump strength. The strong correlation between the slope and UV bump strength, as found in star-forming galaxies at 0.5\textbackslash lt z\textbackslash lt 2.0, is well reproduced when the abundance of the UV bump carriers is assumed to be 30\%-40\% of that of the MW dust; radiative transfer effects lead to shallower attenuation curves with weaker UV bumps as the ISM is more clumpy and dustier. We also argue that some local starburst galaxies have a UV bump in their attenuation curves, albeit very weak.},

Calculations of the dust destruction timescale have so far been carried out using plane parallel steady shocks, however that approximation breaks down when the destruction timescale becomes longer than that for the evolution of the supernova remnant (SNR) shock. In this paper we present new calculations of grain destruction in evolving, radiative SNRs. To facilitate comparison with the previous study by Jones et al. (1996), we adopt the same dust properties as in that paper. We find that the efficiencies of grain destruction are most divergent from those for a steady shock when the thermal history of a shocked gas parcel in the SNR differs significantly from that behind a steady shock. This occurs in shocks with velocities {$>\sptilde$} 200 km/s for which the remnant is just beginning to go radiative. Assuming SNRs evolve in a warm phase dominated ISM, we find dust destruction timescales are increased by a factor of \textasciitilde 2 compared to those of Jones et al. (1996), who assumed a hot gas dominated ISM. Recent estimates of supernova rates and ISM mass lead to another factor of \textasciitilde 3 increase in the destruction timescales, resulting in a silicate grain destruction timescale of \textasciitilde 2-3 Gyr. These increases, while not able resolve the problem of the discrepant timescales for silicate grain destruction and creation, are an important step towards understanding the origin, and evolution of dust in the ISM.},

We use the resulting models to predict galaxy counts and luminosity functions from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the submillimetre, from redshift five to the present, and compare with an extensive compilation of observations. We find that in order to reproduce the rest-UV and optical luminosity functions at high redshift, we must assume an evolving normalization in the dust-to-metal ratio, implying that galaxies of a given bolometric luminosity (or metal column density) must be less extinguished than their local counterparts. In our best-fitting model, we find remarkably good agreement with observations from rest \texttildelow 1500 \AA{} to ?m. At longer wavelengths, most dramatically in the submillimetre, our models underpredict the number of bright galaxies by a large factor. The models reproduce the observed total IR luminosity function fairly well. We show the results of varying several ingredients of the models, including various aspects of the dust attenuation recipe, the dust emission templates and the cosmology.

After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is \textasciitilde 0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR(M *, t) = (0.84 {$\pm$} 0.02 - 0.026 {$\pm$} 0.003 \texttimes{} t)log M * - (6.51 {$\pm$} 0.24 - 0.11 {$\pm$} 0.03 \texttimes{} t), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-{$\tau$} models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1{$\sigma$} spread in formation times of \textasciitilde 1.4 Gyr.},

  abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

Here, we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies, and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k {$\sim$} 10 h Mpc-1 by 20 per cent. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at its mean redshift z {$\simeq$} 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range of109-1010 h-2 M{$\odot$}. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy autocorrelation function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope {$\gamma$} is nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from {$\gamma$} {$\sim$} 1.8 at redshift z = 0 to {$\gamma$} {$\sim$} 1.6 at redshift z {$\sim$} 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale dependences in the bias of different observational tracers of large-scale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around {$\sim$} 5 per cent.},

Dust grains are effective in absorbing and scattering ultraviolet (UV)/optical radiation, and they re-emit the absorbed energy at infrared wavelengths. Understanding the intrinsic properties of these objects, including the dust itself, therefore requires 3D dust radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Unfortunately, the 3D dust RT problem is nonlocal and nonlinear, which makes it one of the hardest challenges in computational astrophysics. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in the past decade, with an increasing number of codes capable of dealing with the complete 3D dust RT problem. We discuss the complexity of this problem, the two most successful solution techniques [ray-tracing (RayT) and Monte Carlo (MC)], and the state of the art in modeling observational data using 3D dust RT codes. We end with an outlook on the bright future of this field.},

In each of six redshift bins, the cosmological distances will be measured to 3\% precision via the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale, and redshift-space distortion measures will constrain structure growth to 6\% precision. In the near-field cosmology program, radial velocities and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way and M 31 will be used to infer the past assembly histories of spiral galaxies and the structure of their dark matter halos. Data will be secured for 106 stars in the Galactic thick-disk, halo, and tidal streams as faint as V \texttildelow{} 22, including stars with V {$<$} 20 to complement the goals of the Gaia mission.

  abstract = {The paper is concerned with methods for the estimation of the coalescence time (time since the most recent common ancestor) of a sample of intraspecies DNA sequences. The methods take advantage of prior knowledge of population demography, in addition to the molecular data. While some theoretical results are presented, a central focus is on computational methods. These methods are easy to implement, and, since explicit formulae tend to be either unavailable or unilluminating, they are also more useful and more informative in most applications. Extensions are presented that allow for the effects of uncertainty in our knowledge of population size and mutation rates, for variability in population sizes, for regions of different mutation rate, and for inference concerning the coalescence time of the entire population. The methods are illustrated using recent data from the human Y chromosome.},

  abstract = {The properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate with larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias. However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to decompose galaxies into those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of galaxies, f\_q, and large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes, there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f\_q and rho. We use the group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f\_q-rho correlation is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment, which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass central galaxies (Mgal {$<\sptilde$} 10\^10.0 Msol/h\^2), there is no correlation between f\_q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in old halos.

  abstract = {Using group catalogues from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data  Release 7, we measure galactic conformity in the local universe. We measure the quenched fraction of neighbour galaxies around isolated primary galaxies, dividing the isolated sample into star-forming and quiescent objects. We restrict our measurements to scales {$>$}1 Mpc to probe the correlations between halo formation histories. Over the stellar mass range 109.7 {$\leq$} M*/M{$\odot$} {$\leq$} 1010.9, we find minimal evidence for conformity. We further compare these data to predictions of the halo age-matching model, in which the oldest galaxies are associated with the oldest haloes. For models with strong correlations between halo and stellar age, the conformity is too large to be consistent with the data. Weaker implementations of the age-matching model would not produce a detectable signal in SDSS data. We reproduce the results of Kauffmann et al., in which the star formation rates of neighbour galaxies are reduced around primary galaxies when the primaries are low star formers. However, we find this result is mainly driven by contamination in the isolation criterion; when removing the small fraction of satellite galaxies in the sample, the conformity signal largely goes away. Lastly, we show that small conformity signals, i.e. 2-5 per cent differences in the quenched fractions of neighbour galaxies, can be produced by mechanisms other than halo assembly bias. For example, if passive galaxies occupy more massive haloes than star-forming galaxies of the same stellar mass, a conformity signal that is consistent with recent measurements from PRIMUS (Berti et al.) can be produced.},

We take into account obscuration by dust in birth clouds and diffuse interstellar medium using a two-component screen model, following the prescription of Charlot and Fall. We compare models in which the dust optical depth is constant to models where it depends on gas metallicity, gas fraction and orientation. The colours of EAGLE galaxies for the more sophisticated models are in broad agreement with those of observed galaxies. In particular, EAGLE produces a red sequence of passive galaxies and a blue cloud of star-forming galaxies, with approximately the correct fraction of galaxies in each population and with g - r colours within 0.1 mag of those observed. Luminosity functions from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths differ from observations at a level comparable to systematic shifts resulting from a choice between Petrosian and Kron photometric apertures. Despite the generally good agreement there are clear discrepancies with observations. The blue cloud of EAGLE galaxies extends to somewhat higher luminosities than in the data, consistent with the modest underestimate of the passive fraction in massive EAGLE galaxies. There is also a moderate excess of bright blue galaxies compared to observations. The overall level of agreement with the observed colour distribution suggests that EAGLE galaxies at z = 0.1 have ages, metallicities and levels of obscuration that are comparable to those of observed galaxies.},

The modelling includes a subgrid prescription for dusty star-forming regions, with both the subgrid obscuration of these regions and the fraction of metals in diffuse interstellar dust calibrated against far-infrared fluxes of local galaxies. The predicted optical colours as a function of stellar mass agree well with observation, with the skirt model showing marked improvement over a simple dust-screen model. The orientation dependence of attenuation is weaker than observed because eagle galaxies are generally puffier than real galaxies, due to the pressure floor imposed on the interstellar medium (ISM). The mock H {$\alpha$} luminosity function agrees reasonably well with the data, and we quantify the extent to which dust obscuration affects observed H {$\alpha$} fluxes. The distribution of D4000 break values is bimodal, as observed. In the simulation, 20 per cent of galaxies deemed 'passive' for the skirt model, I.e. exhibiting D4000 {$>$}1.8, are classified 'active' when ISM dust attenuation is not included. The fraction of galaxies with stellar mass greater than 1010 M{$\odot$} that are deemed passive is slightly smaller than observed, which is due to low levels of residual star formation in these simulated galaxies.

We recover relatively tight relations between these parameters for the EAGLE sample, but also provide the scatter in these parameters owing to the morphological variation and orientation of galaxies. We also find that these relations are nearly independent of redshift in the EAGLE model. By pairing our model with an empirical prescription for birth clouds below the resolution scale of the simulation, we reproduce the observed relation between attenuation slope and optical depth for the first time in a cosmological simulation. We demonstrate that this result is remarkably independent of the attenuation properties assumed for the birth cloud screen, merely requiring a boosted attenuation for infant stars. We present this model with a view to interpreting observations, as well as processing semi-analytic models and other hydrodynamic simulations.},

We compare these to \textasciitilde 800 observed galaxies in the UV-submillimetre range, from the DustPedia sample of nearby galaxies. To derive global properties, we apply the SED fitting code CIGALE consistently to both data sets, using the same set of \textasciitilde 80 million models. The results of this comparison reveal overall agreement between the simulations and observations, both in the SEDs and in the derived physical properties, with a number of discrepancies. The optical and far-infrared regimes, and the scaling relations based upon the global emission, diffuse dust and stellar mass, show high levels of agreement. However, the mid-infrared fluxes of the EAGLE galaxies are overestimated while the far-UV domain is not attenuated enough, compared to the observations. We attribute these discrepancies to a combination of galaxy population differences between the samples, and limitations in the subgrid treatment of star-forming regions in the EAGLE-SKIRT post-processing recipe. Our findings show the importance of detailed radiative transfer calculations and consistent comparison, and provide suggestions for improved numerical models.},

This data set is combined with ancillary optical and NIR fluxes to constrain the dust attenuation law in the rest-frame NUV region of star-forming galaxies within the redshift window 1.5 {$<$} z {$<$} 3. We focus on the NUV bump strength (B) and the total-to-selective extinction ratio (RV), targeting a sample of 1753 galaxies. By comparing the data with a set of population synthesis models coupled to a parametric dust attenuation law, we constrain RV and B, as well as the colour excess, E(B - V). We find a correlation between RV and B, which can be interpreted either as a result of the grain size distribution, or a variation of the dust geometry among galaxies. According to the former, small dust grains are associated with a stronger NUV bump. The latter would lead to a range of clumpiness in the distribution of dust within the interstellar medium of star-forming galaxies. The observed wide range of NUV bump strengths can lead to a systematic in the interpretation of the UV slope {$\beta$} typically used to characterize the dust content. In this study, we quantify these variations, concluding that the effects are {$\Delta\beta$} {$\sim$} 0.4.},

At z = 0 gravitational forces are softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 \texttimes{} 18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve 18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

Here, we exploit the large dynamic range of the IllustrisTNG simulation suite, TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300, to derive multiband galaxy luminosity functions from z = 2 to z = 10. We put particular emphasis on the exploration of different dust attenuation models to determine galaxy luminosity functions for the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), and apparent wide NIRCam bands. Our most detailed dust model is based on continuum Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations employing observationally calibrated dust properties. This calibration results in constraints on the redshift evolution of the dust attenuation normalization and dust-to-metal ratios yielding a stronger redshift evolution of the attenuation normalization compared to most previous theoretical studies. Overall we find good agreement between the rest-frame UV luminosity functions and observational data for all redshifts, also beyond the regimes used for the dust model calibrations. Furthermore, we also recover the observed high-redshift (z = 4-6) UV luminosity versus stellar mass relation, the H {$\alpha$} versus star formation rate relation, and the H {$\alpha$} luminosity function at z = 2. The bright end (MUV {$>$} -19.5) cumulative galaxy number densities are consistent with observational data.

Model predictions and fitting procedures have improved significantly over this time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of available data. We review here the field of SED fitting, describing the modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy SEDs, the creation of multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to fit model SEDs to observed galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major ingredients of SED fitting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models, and the best fitting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that SED fitting can be used effectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies, such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in a galaxy, finer details of dust properties and dust-star geometry, and the influences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties. The present review will be made available on an interactive, moderated web page (http://sedfitting.org), where the community can access and change the text.

The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10\^12 Msun, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

The employed model for SMBH growth and feedback assumes a two-mode scenario in which the feedback from active galactic nuclei occurs through a kinetic, comparatively efficient mode at low accretion rates relative to the Eddington limit, and in the form of a thermal, less efficient mode at high accretion rates. We show that the quenching of massive central galaxies happens coincidently with kinetic-mode feedback, consistent with the notion that active supermassive black holes cause the low specific star formation rates observed in massive galaxies. However, major galaxy mergers are not responsible for initiating most of the quenching events in our model. Up to black hole masses of about 10\^\{8.5\} M\_\{{$\odot\rbrace$}, the dominant growth channel for SMBHs is in the thermal mode. Higher mass black holes stay mainly in the kinetic mode and gas accretion is self-regulated via their feedback, which causes their Eddington ratios to drop, with SMBH mergers becoming the main channel for residual mass growth. As a consequence, the quasar luminosity function is dominated by rapidly accreting, moderately massive black holes in the thermal mode. We show that the associated growth history of SMBHs produces a low-redshift quasar luminosity function and a redshift zero black hole mass - stellar bulge mass relation is in good agreement with observations, whereas the simulation tends to overpredict the high-redshift quasar luminosity function.\vphantom\}},

For example, Gaussian distributions are an insufficient representation for errors in quantities like photometric redshifts. Likewise, it can be difficult to quantify analytically the distribution of errors that are introduced in complex fitting codes. Without a simple form for these distributions, it becomes difficult to accurately construct a likelihood function for the data as a function of parameters of interest. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) provides a means of probing the posterior distribution when direct calculation of a sufficiently accurate likelihood is intractable. ABC allows one to bypass direct calculation of the likelihood but instead relies upon the ability to simulate the forward process that generated the data. These simulations can naturally incorporate priors placed on nuisance parameters, and hence these can be marginalized in a natural way. We present and discuss ABC methods in the context of supernova cosmology using data from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey. Assuming a flat cosmology and constant dark energy equation of state, we demonstrate that ABC can recover an accurate posterior distribution. Finally, we show that ABC can still produce an accurate posterior distribution when we contaminate the sample with Type IIP supernovae.},

  abstract = {We present a systematic study of the shape of the dust attenuation curve  in star-forming galaxies from the far-ultraviolet (far-UV) to the near-infrared (NIR; {$\sim$}0.15-2 {$\mu$} m), as a function of specific star formation rate ({$\psi$}S) and axial ratio (b/a), for galaxies with and without a significant bulge. Our sample comprises 23 000 (15 000) galaxies with a median redshift of 0.07, with photometric entries in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey-Large Area Survey and Galaxy Evolution Explorer-All-Sky Imaging Survey catalogues and emission-line measurements from the SDSS spectroscopic survey. We develop a new pair-matching technique to isolate the dust attenuation curves from the stellar continuum emission. The main results are: (i) the slope of the attenuation curve in the optical varies weakly with {$\psi$}S, strongly with b/a, and is significantly steeper than the Milky Way extinction law in bulge-dominated galaxies; (ii) the NIR slope is constant and matches the slope of the Milky Way extinction law; (iii) the UV has a slope change consistent with a dust bump at 2175 \AA{} which is evident in all samples and varies strongly in strength with b/a in the bulge-dominated sample; (iv) there is a strong increase in emission-line-to-continuum dust attenuation ({$\tau$}V, line/{$\tau$}V, cont) with both decreasing {$\psi$}S and increasing b/a; and (v) radial gradients in dust attenuation increase strongly with increasing {$\psi$}S, and the presence of a bulge does not alter the strength of the gradients. These results are consistent with the picture in which young stars are surrounded by dense 'birth clouds' with low covering factor which disperse on time-scales of {$\sim$}107 yr and the diffuse interstellar dust is distributed in a centrally concentrated disc with a smaller scaleheight than the older stars that contribute the majority of the red and NIR light. Within this model, the path-length of diffuse dust, but not of birth-cloud dust, increases with increasing inclination and the apparent optical attenuation curve is steepened by the differential effect of larger dust opacity towards younger stars than towards older stars. Additionally, our findings suggest that: (i) galaxies with higher star formation rates per unit stellar mass have a higher fraction of diffuse dust, which is more centrally concentrated; (ii) the observed strength of the 2175-\AA{} dust feature is affected predominantly by global geometry; and (iii) only highly inclined discs are optically thick. We provide new empirically derived attenuation curves for correcting the light from star-forming galaxies for dust attenuation.},

  abstract = {The observed ultraviolet continuum (UVC) slope is potentially a powerful  diagnostic of dust obscuration in star-forming galaxies. However, the intrinsic slope is also sensitive to the form of the stellar initial mass function and to the recent star formation and metal enrichment histories of a galaxy. Using the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, we investigate the intrinsic distribution of UVC slopes. For star-forming galaxies, we find that the intrinsic distribution of UVC slopes at z= 0, parametrized by the power-law index {$\beta$}, has a standard deviation of {$\sigma\beta\simeq$} 0.30. This suggests an uncertainty on the inferred ultraviolet (UV) attenuation of Afuv{$\simeq$} 0.7 (assuming a Calzetti attenuation curve) for an individual object, even with perfect photometry. Furthermore, we find that the intrinsic UVC slope correlates with star formation rate, intrinsic UV luminosity, stellar mass and redshift. These correlations have implications for the interpretation of trends in the observed UVC slope with these quantities irrespective of the sample size or quality of the photometry. Our results suggest that in some cases the attenuation by dust has been incorrectly estimated.},

  abstract = {We studied the radiative transfer in a spherical, two-phase clumpy  medium, in which coherent, nonconservative scattering is the dominant opacity source and where the source of photons is situated at the center. The structure of the medium is random but statistically homogeneous and is characterized by the density ratio between the low- and high-density phases, the optical depth radius of the equivalent homogeneous dust distribution, the filling factor of high-density clumps, and the length scale of individual clumps. We examined in detail the cloud mass spectrum, the distribution of optical depths, and the apparent fractal nature of the projected cloud structures. The photometric characteristics of the clumpy scattering system are studied as a function of density contrast between the two phases, of the filling factor, and of the length scale of high-density clumps, and they are compared with those of homogeneous, constant-density distributions of equal effective optical depth. Direction-averaged surface brightness distributions of the scattered light are studied for both optically thick and optically thin cases, which reveal the important role of scattering by the optically thin interclump medium. The conversion of UV/optical/near-IR radiation into thermal far-IR dust radiation in a dusty system is profoundly affected by the structure of the medium; the homogeneous, constant-density distribution always provides the highest conversion efficiency for any given geometry and dust mass. The effective optical depth of a clumpy distribution is known not to scale linearly with the equivalent optical depth of a homogeneous distribution of equal dust mass; this leads to effective attenuation laws that differ from the original opacity law assumed for the dust in the system. The expected reddening is substantially reduced for clumpy media. Finally, since the scattering response of a clumpy system is consistently that of an equivalent system of lower effective optical depth and lower effective albedo, efforts to determine the dust albedo of real systems with clumpy dust distributions by employing models, which are homogeneous, can lead to a bias toward albedo values that are too low.},

  abstract = {We present and discuss the results of new multiple-scattering radiative transfer calculations for three representative types of galactic environments, filled with either homogeneous or two-phase clumpy dust distributions. Extinction and scattering properties for two types of interstellar dust, similar to those found in the average diffuse medium of the Milky Way (MW) and the Bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), are considered. The wavelength coverage extends from 1000 to 30000 \AA, with particular emphasis on the rest-frame UV. This makes these models especially applicable to starburst galaxies and Lyman-break galaxy samples. The examination of the models concentrates on the study of UV/visual/near-IR reddening effects, the wavelength dependence of attenuation, and on the changes that arise from the transition from homogeneous to clumpy dust distributions in different star/dust geometries. Embedded dust, especially when clumpy, leads to saturation at fairly low reddening values with correspondingly gray attenuation functions. This makes the assessment of the attenuation of the far-UV flux from starburst galaxies difficult, if only UV/visual/near-IR data are available. Existing data for UV-selected starburst galaxies indicate a range of UV attenuation factors of 0-150. Our models reproduce the ``Calzetti Attenuation Law,'' provided one adopts SMC-type dust and a clumpy shell-type dust distribution surrounding the starbursts. The average far-UV attenuation factor for the Calzetti sample is found to be 7.4. The only relatively reliable measure for the UV attenuation factor for single galaxies was found in the ratio of the integrated far-IR flux to the far-UV flux, measured near 1600 \AA, requiring the measurement of the entire spectral energy distribution of galaxies.},

  abstract = {We consider the origin of the UV-bright phase of metal-rich helium-burning stars, the slow blue phase (SBP) that was predicted by various earlier works. Based on improved physics including OPAL opacities, which is the same physics that was used in the construction of the new Yale Isochrones, we confirm the existence of the SBP. In addition to our grid of evolutionary tracks, we provide an analytical understanding of the main characteristics of the SBP phenomenon. The SBP is slow because it is a slow-evolving, helium-shell-burning phase that is analogous to the early asymptotic giant branch phase. The SBP of a more metal-rich star is slower than a metal-poor counterpart if they have the same Teff because a more metal-rich helium-burning star has a smaller mass than a metal-poor one and because lifetime increases as mass decreases. Metal-rich helium-burning stars easily become hot because the luminosity from the hydrogen-burning shell is extremely sensitive to the mean molecular weight {$\mu$}, whereas the luminosity from the helium-burning core is not. Under the assumption of a positive {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z, helium abundance plays the most important role in governing {$\mu$}, and thus Dorman et al. found that the SBP occurs only when Y {$>\sptilde$} 0.4 when {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z {$>\sptilde$} 0. We suggest that the SBP phenomenon is a major cause of the UV upturn phenomenon in giant elliptical galaxies, as will be shown in subsequent papers. The new HB tracks can be retrieved from S.
