# galpopFM
forward modeling galaxy populations


## To-do
- [ ] figure out parameterization tauV(Mstar) (see Fig 4 of Salim+2018)
- [ ] measuring Halpha, Hbeta, Balmer decrement, E(B-V) in order to infer V-band attenuation
- [ ] distance metric will be comparing A(V)-V relation and A(FUV)-FUV relations 
- [ ] implement ABC-PMC with distance metric
